              "'\\ufeffOne morning when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams he found\\nhimself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin  He lay on\\nhis armourlike back and if he lifted his head a little he could\\nsee his brown belly slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff\\nsections  The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready\\nto slide off any moment  His many legs pitifully thin compared\\nwith the size of the rest of him waved about helplessly as he\\nlooked\\n\\n\\nWhats happened to me he thought  It wasnt a dream  His room\\na proper human room although a little too small lay peacefully\\nbetween its four familiar walls  A collection of textile samples\\nlay spread out on the table  Samsa was a travelling salesman  and\\nabove it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an\\nillustrated magazine and housed in a nice gilded frame  It showed\\na lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright\\nraising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm\\ntowards the viewer\\n\\n\\nGregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather\\nDrops of rain could be heard hitting the pane which made him feel\\nquite sad  How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all\\nthis nonsense he thought but that was something he was unable to\\ndo because he was used to sleeping on his right and in his present\\nstate couldnt get into that position  However hard he threw\\nhimself onto his right he always rolled back to where he was  He\\nmust have tried it a hundred times shut his eyes so that he\\nwouldnt have to look at the floundering legs and only stopped when\\nhe began to feel a mild dull pain there that he had never felt\\nbefore\\n\\n\\nOh God he thought what a strenuous career it is that Ive\\nchosen Travelling day in and day out  Doing business like this\\ntakes much more effort than doing your own business at home and on\\ntop of that theres the curse of travelling worries about making\\ntrain connections bad and irregular food contact with different\\npeople all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or\\nbecome friendly with them  It can all go to Hell  He felt a\\nslight itch up on his belly pushed himself slowly up on his back\\ntowards the headboard so that he could lift his head better found\\nwhere the itch was and saw that it was covered with lots of little\\nwhite spots which he didnt know what to make of and when he tried\\nto feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back\\nbecause as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder\\n\\n\\nHe slid back into his former position  Getting up early all the\\ntime he thought it makes you stupid  Youve got to get enough\\nsleep  Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury  For\\ninstance whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning\\nto copy out the contract these gentlemen are always still sitting\\nthere eating their breakfasts  I ought to just try that with my\\nboss Id get kicked out on the spot  But who knows maybe that\\nwould be the best thing for me  If I didnt have my parents to\\nthink about Id have given in my notice a long time ago Id have\\ngone up to the boss and told him just what I think tell him\\neverything I would let him know just what I feel  Hed fall right\\noff his desk And its a funny sort of business to be sitting up\\nthere at your desk talking down at your subordinates from up there\\nespecially when you have to go right up close because the boss is\\nhard of hearing  Well theres still some hope once Ive got the\\nmoney together to pay off my parents debt to him  another five or\\nsix years I suppose  thats definitely what Ill do  Thats when\\nIll make the big change  First of all though Ive got to get up\\nmy train leaves at five\\n\\n\\nAnd he looked over at the alarm clock ticking on the chest of\\ndrawers  God in Heaven he thought  It was half past six and the\\nhands were quietly moving forwards it was even later than half\\npast more like quarter to seven  Had the alarm clock not rung He\\ncould see from the bed that it had been set for four oclock as it\\nshould have been it certainly must have rung  Yes but was it\\npossible to quietly sleep through that furniturerattling noise\\nTrue he had not slept peacefully but probably all the more deeply\\nbecause of that  What should he do now The next train went at\\nseven if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and\\nthe collection of samples was still not packed and he did not at\\nall feel particularly fresh and lively  And even if he did catch\\nthe train he would not avoid his bosss anger as the office\\nassistant would have been there to see the five oclock train go he\\nwould have put in his report about Gregors not being there a long\\ntime ago  The office assistant was the bosss man spineless and\\nwith no understanding  What about if he reported sick But that\\nwould be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of\\nservice Gregor had never once yet been ill  His boss would\\ncertainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance\\ncompany accuse his parents of having a lazy son and accept the\\ndoctors recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed\\nthat noone was ever ill but that many were workshy  And whats\\nmore would he have been entirely wrong in this case Gregor did in\\nfact apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long\\nfeel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual\\n\\n\\nHe was still hurriedly thinking all this through unable to decide\\nto get out of the bed when the clock struck quarter to seven\\nThere was a cautious knock at the door near his head  Gregor\\nsomebody called  it was his mother  its quarter to seven\\nDidnt you want to go somewhere  That gentle voice Gregor was\\nshocked when he heard his own voice answering it could hardly be\\nrecognised as the voice he had had before  As if from deep inside\\nhim there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with\\nit the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort\\nof echo which made them unclear leaving the hearer unsure whether\\nhe had heard properly or not  Gregor had wanted to give a full\\nanswer and explain everything but in the circumstances contented\\nhimself with saying Yes mother yes thankyou Im getting up\\nnow  The change in Gregors voice probably could not be noticed\\noutside through the wooden door as his mother was satisfied with\\nthis explanation and shuffled away  But this short conversation\\nmade the other members of the family aware that Gregor against\\ntheir expectations was still at home and soon his father came\\nknocking at one of the side doors gently but with his fist\\nGregor Gregor he called whats wrong  And after a short\\nwhile he called again with a warning deepness in his voice Gregor\\nGregor  At the other side door his sister came plaintively\\nGregor Arent you well Do you need anything  Gregor answered to\\nboth sides Im ready now making an effort to remove all the\\nstrangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting\\nlong pauses between each individual word  His father went back to\\nhis breakfast but his sister whispered Gregor open the door I\\nbeg of you  Gregor however had no thought of opening the door\\nand instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit acquired\\nfrom his travelling of locking all doors at night even when he was\\nat home\\n\\n\\nThe first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being\\ndisturbed to get dressed and most of all to have his breakfast\\nOnly then would he consider what to do next as he was well aware\\nthat he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by\\nlying in bed  He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in\\nbed perhaps caused by lying awkwardly but that had always turned\\nout to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would\\nslowly resolve themselves today  He did not have the slightest\\ndoubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first\\nsign of a serious cold which was an occupational hazard for\\ntravelling salesmen\\n\\n\\nIt was a simple matter to throw off the covers he only had to blow\\nhimself up a little and they fell off by themselves  But it became\\ndifficult after that especially as he was so exceptionally broad\\nHe would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up but\\ninstead of them he only had all those little legs continuously\\nmoving in different directions and which he was moreover unable to\\ncontrol  If he wanted to bend one of them then that was the first\\none that would stretch itself out and if he finally managed to do\\nwhat he wanted with that leg all the others seemed to be set free\\nand would move about painfully  This is something that cant be\\ndone in bed Gregor said to himself so dont keep trying to do\\nit\\n\\n\\nThe first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body\\nout of the bed but he had never seen this lower part and could not\\nimagine what it looked like it turned out to be too hard to move\\nit went so slowly and finally almost in a frenzy when he\\ncarelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could\\ngather he chose the wrong direction hit hard against the lower\\nbedpost and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower\\npart of his body might well at present be the most sensitive\\n\\n\\nSo then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed\\nfirst carefully turning his head to the side  This he managed\\nquite easily and despite its breadth and its weight the bulk of\\nhis body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head\\nBut when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the\\nfresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be\\na miracle if his head were not injured so he became afraid to carry\\non pushing himself forward the same way  And he could not knock\\nhimself out now at any price better to stay in bed than lose\\nconsciousness\\n\\n\\nIt took just as much effort to get back to where he had been\\nearlier but when he lay there sighing and was once more watching\\nhis legs as they struggled against each other even harder than\\nbefore if that was possible he could think of no way of bringing\\npeace and order to this chaos  He told himself once more that it\\nwas not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible\\nthing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at\\nwhatever sacrifice  At the same time though he did not forget to\\nremind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing\\nto desperate conclusions  At times like this he would direct his\\neyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could but\\nunfortunately even the other side of the narrow street was\\nenveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer\\nto offer him  Seven oclock already he said to himself when the\\nclock struck again seven oclock and theres still a fog like\\nthis  And he lay there quietly a while longer breathing lightly\\nas if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back\\nto their real and natural state\\n\\n\\nBut then he said to himself Before it strikes quarter past seven\\nIll definitely have to have got properly out of bed  And by then\\nsomebody will have come round from work to ask whats happened to me\\nas well as they open up at work before seven oclock  And so he\\nset himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body\\nout of the bed all at the same time  If he succeeded in falling out\\nof bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could\\nprobably avoid injuring it  His back seemed to be quite hard and\\nprobably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet  His\\nmain concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make and which\\neven through all the doors would probably raise concern if not\\nalarm  But it was something that had to be risked\\n\\n\\nWhen Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed  the new\\nmethod was more of a game than an effort all he had to do was rock\\nback and forth  it occurred to him how simple everything would be\\nif somebody came to help him  Two strong people  he had his father\\nand the maid in mind  would have been more than enough they would\\nonly have to push their arms under the dome of his back peel him\\naway from the bed bend down with the load and then be patient and\\ncareful as he swang over onto the floor where hopefully the\\nlittle legs would find a use  Should he really call for help\\nthough even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked\\nDespite all the difficulty he was in he could not suppress a smile\\nat this thought\\n\\n\\nAfter a while he had already moved so far across that it would have\\nbeen hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard  The\\ntime was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final\\ndecision very soon  Then there was a ring at the door of the flat\\nThatll be someone from work he said to himself and froze very\\nstill although his little legs only became all the more lively as\\nthey danced around  For a moment everything remained quiet\\nTheyre not opening the door Gregor said to himself caught in\\nsome nonsensical hope  But then of course the maids firm steps\\nwent to the door as ever and opened it  Gregor only needed to hear\\nthe visitors first words of greeting and he knew who it was  the\\nchief clerk himself  Why did Gregor have to be the only one\\ncondemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly\\nsuspicious at the slightest shortcoming Were all employees every\\none of them louts was there not one of them who was faithful and\\ndevoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he\\ncouldnt get out of bed if he didnt spend at least a couple of\\nhours in the morning on company business Was it really not enough\\nto let one of the trainees make enquiries  assuming enquiries were\\neven necessary  did the chief clerk have to come himself and did\\nthey have to show the whole innocent family that this was so\\nsuspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the\\nwisdom to investigate it And more because these thoughts had made\\nhim upset than through any proper decision he swang himself with\\nall his force out of the bed  There was a loud thump but it wasnt\\nreally a loud noise  His fall was softened a little by the carpet\\nand Gregors back was also more elastic than he had thought which\\nmade the sound muffled and not too noticeable  He had not held his\\nhead carefully enough though and hit it as he fell annoyed and in\\npain he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet\\n\\n\\nSomethings fallen down in there said the chief clerk in the room\\non the left  Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort\\nthat had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk\\ntoo you had to concede that it was possible  But as if in gruff\\nreply to this question the chief clerks firm footsteps in his\\nhighly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room\\nFrom the room on his right Gregors sister whispered to him to let\\nhim know Gregor the chief clerk is here  Yes I know said\\nGregor to himself but without daring to raise his voice loud enough\\nfor his sister to hear him\\n\\n\\nGregor said his father now from the room to his left the chief\\nclerk has come round and wants to know why you didnt leave on the\\nearly train  We dont know what to say to him  And anyway he\\nwants to speak to you personally  So please open up this door  Im\\nsure hell be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room\\nThen the chief clerk called Good morning  Mr Samsa He isnt\\nwell said his mother to the chief clerk while his father\\ncontinued to speak through the door  He isnt well please believe\\nme  Why else would Gregor have missed a train The lad only ever\\nthinks about the business  It nearly makes me cross the way he\\nnever goes out in the evenings hes been in town for a week now but\\nstayed home every evening  He sits with us in the kitchen and just\\nreads the paper or studies train timetables  His idea of relaxation\\nis working with his fretsaw  Hes made a little frame for\\ninstance it only took him two or three evenings youll be amazed\\nhow nice it is its hanging up in his room youll see it as soon\\nas Gregor opens the door  Anyway Im glad youre here we wouldnt\\nhave been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves hes so\\nstubborn and Im sure he isnt well he said this morning that he\\nis but he isnt  Ill be there in a moment said Gregor slowly\\nand thoughtfully but without moving so that he would not miss any\\nword of the conversation  Well I cant think of any other way of\\nexplaining it  Mrs Samsa said the chief clerk I hope its\\nnothing serious  But on the other hand I must say that if we\\npeople in commerce ever become slightly unwell then fortunately or\\nunfortunately as you like we simply have to overcome it because of\\nbusiness considerations  Can the chief clerk come in to see you\\nnow then asked his father impatiently knocking at the door\\nagain  No said Gregor  In the room on his right there followed\\na painful silence in the room on his left his sister began to cry\\n\\n\\nSo why did his sister not go and join the others She had probably\\nonly just got up and had not even begun to get dressed  And why was\\nshe crying Was it because he had not got up and had not let the\\nchief clerk in because he was in danger of losing his job and if\\nthat happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the\\nsame demands as before There was no need to worry about things like\\nthat yet  Gregor was still there and had not the slightest\\nintention of abandoning his family  For the time being he just lay\\nthere on the carpet and noone who knew the condition he was in\\nwould seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in  It was\\nonly a minor discourtesy and a suitable excuse could easily be\\nfound for it later on it was not something for which Gregor could\\nbe sacked on the spot  And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible\\nto leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at\\nhim and crying  But the others didnt know what was happening they\\nwere worried that would excuse their behaviour\\n\\n\\nThe chief clerk now raised his voice Mr Samsa he called to him\\nwhat is wrong You barricade yourself in your room give us no more\\nthan yes or no for an answer you are causing serious and\\nunnecessary concern to your parents and you fail  and I mention\\nthis just by the way  you fail to carry out your business duties in\\na way that is quite unheard of  Im speaking here on behalf of your\\nparents and of your employer and really must request a clear and\\nimmediate explanation  I am astonished quite astonished  I\\nthought I knew you as a calm and sensible person and now you\\nsuddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims  This morning\\nyour employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to\\nappear its true  it had to do with the money that was recently\\nentrusted to you  but I came near to giving him my word of honour\\nthat that could not be the right explanation  But now that I see\\nyour incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish\\nwhatsoever to intercede on your behalf  And nor is your position\\nall that secure  I had originally intended to say all this to you\\nin private but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good\\nreason I dont see why your parents should not also learn of it\\nYour turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late I grant you that\\nits not the time of year to do especially good business we\\nrecognise that but there simply is no time of year to do no\\nbusiness at all  Mr Samsa we cannot allow there to be\\n\\n\\nBut Sir called Gregor beside himself and forgetting all else in\\nthe excitement Ill open up immediately just a moment  Im\\nslightly unwell an attack of dizziness I havent been able to get\\nup  Im still in bed now  Im quite fresh again now though  Im\\njust getting out of bed  Just a moment  Be patient Its not quite\\nas easy as Id thought  Im quite alright now though  Its\\nshocking what can suddenly happen to a person I was quite alright\\nlast night my parents know about it perhaps better than me I had\\na small symptom of it last night already  They must have noticed\\nit  I dont know why I didnt let you know at work But you always\\nthink you can get over an illness without staying at home  Please\\ndont make my parents suffer Theres no basis for any of the\\naccusations youre making nobodys ever said a word to me about any\\nof these things  Maybe you havent read the latest contracts I sent\\nin  Ill set off with the eight oclock train as well these few\\nhours of rest have given me strength  You dont need to wait sir\\nIll be in the office soon after you and please be so good as to\\ntell that to the boss and recommend me to him\\n\\n\\nAnd while Gregor gushed out these words hardly knowing what he was\\nsaying he made his way over to the chest of drawers  this was\\neasily done probably because of the practise he had already had in\\nbed  where he now tried to get himself upright  He really did want\\nto open the door really did want to let them see him and to speak\\nwith the chief clerk the others were being so insistent and he was\\ncurious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him\\nIf they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregors\\nresponsibility and he could rest  If however they took everything\\ncalmly he would still have no reason to be upset and if he hurried\\nhe really could be at the station for eight oclock  The first few\\ntimes he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just\\nslid down again but he finally gave himself one last swing and\\nstood there upright the lower part of his body was in serious pain\\nbut he no longer gave any attention to it  Now he let himself fall\\nagainst the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of\\nit with his little legs  By now he had also calmed down and kept\\nquiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying\\n\\n\\nDid you understand a word of all that the chief clerk asked his\\nparents surely hes not trying to make fools of us Oh God\\ncalled his mother who was already in tears he could be seriously\\nill and were making him suffer  Grete Grete she then cried\\nMother his sister called from the other side  They communicated\\nacross Gregors room  Youll have to go for the doctor straight\\naway  Gregor is ill  Quick get the doctor  Did you hear the way\\nGregor spoke just now  That was the voice of an animal said the\\nchief clerk with a calmness that was in contrast with his mothers\\nscreams  Anna Anna his father called into the kitchen through\\nthe entrance hall clapping his hands get a locksmith here now\\nAnd the two girls their skirts swishing immediately ran out\\nthrough the hall wrenching open the front door of the flat as they\\nwent  How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly There\\nwas no sound of the door banging shut again they must have left it\\nopen  people often do in homes where something awful has happened\\n\\n\\nGregor in contrast had become much calmer  So they couldnt\\nunderstand his words any more although they seemed clear enough to\\nhim clearer than before  perhaps his ears had become used to the\\nsound  They had realised though that there was something wrong\\nwith him and were ready to help  The first response to his\\nsituation had been confident and wise and that made him feel\\nbetter  He felt that he had been drawn back in among people and\\nfrom the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising\\nachievements  although he did not really distinguish one from the\\nother  Whatever was said next would be crucial so in order to\\nmake his voice as clear as possible he coughed a little but taking\\ncare to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound\\ndifferent from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure\\nhe could judge this for himself  Meanwhile it had become very\\nquiet in the next room  Perhaps his parents were sat at the table\\nwhispering with the chief clerk or perhaps they were all pressed\\nagainst the door and listening\\n\\n\\nGregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair  Once\\nthere he let go of it and threw himself onto the door holding\\nhimself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his\\nlegs  He rested there a little while to recover from the effort\\ninvolved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the\\nlock with his mouth  He seemed unfortunately to have no proper\\nteeth  how was he then to grasp the key  but the lack of teeth\\nwas of course made up for with a very strong jaw using the jaw\\nhe really was able to start the key turning ignoring the fact that\\nhe must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came\\nfrom his mouth flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor\\nListen said the chief clerk in the next room hes turning the\\nkey  Gregor was greatly encouraged by this but they all should\\nhave been calling to him his father and his mother too Well done\\nGregor they should have cried keep at it keep hold of the\\nlock  And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his\\nefforts he bit on the key with all his strength paying no\\nattention to the pain he was causing himself  As the key turned\\nround he turned around the lock with it only holding himself\\nupright with his mouth and hung onto the key or pushed it down\\nagain with the whole weight of his body as needed  The clear sound\\nof the lock as it snapped back was Gregors sign that he could break\\nhis concentration and as he regained his breath he said to himself\\nSo I didnt need the locksmith after all Then he lay his head on\\nthe handle of the door to open it completely\\n\\n\\nBecause he had to open the door in this way it was already wide\\nopen before he could be seen  He had first to slowly turn himself\\naround one of the double doors and he had to do it very carefully\\nif he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the\\nroom  He was still occupied with this difficult movement unable to\\npay attention to anything else when he heard the chief clerk\\nexclaim a loud Oh which sounded like the soughing of the wind\\nNow he also saw him  he was the nearest to the door  his hand\\npressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by\\na steady and invisible force  Gregors mother her hair still\\ndishevelled from bed despite the chief clerks being there looked\\nat his father  Then she unfolded her arms took two steps forward\\ntowards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that\\nspread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto\\nher breast  His father looked hostile and clenched his fists as if\\nwanting to knock Gregor back into his room  Then he looked\\nuncertainly round the living room covered his eyes with his hands\\nand wept so that his powerful chest shook\\n\\n\\nSo Gregor did not go into the room but leant against the inside of\\nthe other door which was still held bolted in place  In this way\\nonly half of his body could be seen along with his head above it\\nwhich he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others\\nMeanwhile the day had become much lighter part of the endless\\ngreyblack building on the other side of the street  which was a\\nhospital  could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular\\nline of windows piercing its facade the rain was still\\nfalling now throwing down large individual droplets which hit the\\nground one at a time  The washing up from breakfast lay on the\\ntable there was so much of it because for Gregors father\\nbreakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would\\nstretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of\\ndifferent newspapers  On the wall exactly opposite there was\\nphotograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army his sword\\nin his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth\\nrespect for his uniform and bearing  The door to the entrance hall\\nwas open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could\\nsee onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down\\nbelow\\n\\n\\nNow then said Gregor well aware that he was the only one to\\nhave kept calm Ill get dressed straight away now pack up my\\nsamples and set off  Will you please just let me leave You can\\nsee he said to the chief clerk that Im not stubborn and I\\nlike to do my job being a commercial traveller is arduous but\\nwithout travelling I couldnt earn my living  So where are you\\ngoing in to the office Yes Will you report everything accurately\\nthen Its quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to\\nwork but thats just the right time to remember whats been\\nachieved in the past and consider that later on once the difficulty\\nhas been removed he will certainly work with all the more diligence\\nand concentration  Youre well aware that Im seriously in debt to\\nour employer as well as having to look after my parents and my\\nsister so that Im trapped in a difficult situation but I will\\nwork my way out of it again  Please dont make things any harder\\nfor me than they are already and dont take sides against me at the\\noffice  I know that nobody likes the travellers  They think we\\nearn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it  Thats\\njust prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of\\nit  But you sir you have a better overview than the rest of the\\nstaff in fact if I can say this in confidence a better overview\\nthan the boss himself  its very easy for a businessman like him to\\nmake mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than\\nhe should  And youre also well aware that we travellers spend\\nalmost the whole year away from the office so that we can very\\neasily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints\\nand its almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of\\nthing we dont usually even hear about them or if at all its when\\nwe arrive back home exhausted from a trip and thats when we feel\\nthe harmful effects of whats been going on without even knowing\\nwhat caused them  Please dont go away at least first say\\nsomething to show that you grant that Im at least partly right\\n\\n\\nBut the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to\\nspeak and with protruding lips only stared back at him over his\\ntrembling shoulders as he left  He did not keep still for a moment\\nwhile Gregor was speaking but moved steadily towards the door\\nwithout taking his eyes off him  He moved very gradually as if\\nthere had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room  It was\\nonly when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden\\nmovement drew his foot from the living room and rushed forward in\\na panic  In the hall he stretched his right hand far out towards\\nthe stairway as if out there there were some supernatural force\\nwaiting to save him\\n\\n\\nGregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief\\nclerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be\\nput into extreme danger  That was something his parents did not\\nunderstand very well over the years they had become convinced that\\nthis job would provide for Gregor for his entire life and besides\\nthey had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sight\\nof any thought for the future  Gregor though did think about the\\nfuture  The chief clerk had to be held back calmed down convinced\\nand finally won over the future of Gregor and his family depended\\non it If only his sister were here She was clever she was already\\nin tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully on his back  And\\nthe chief clerk was a lover of women surely she could persuade him\\nshe would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out\\nof his shocked state  But his sister was not there Gregor would\\nhave to do the job himself  And without considering that he still\\nwas not familiar with how well he could move about in his present\\nstate or that his speech still might not  or probably would not \\nbe understood he let go of the door pushed himself through the\\nopening tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who\\nridiculously was holding on to the banister with both hands but\\nGregor fell immediately over and with a little scream as he sought\\nsomething to hold onto landed on his numerous little legs  Hardly\\nhad that happened than for the first time that day he began to\\nfeel alright with his body the little legs had the solid ground\\nunder them to his pleasure they did exactly as he told them they\\nwere even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go and\\nhe was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at\\nan end  He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side\\nas he crouched there on the floor  His mother was not far away in\\nfront of him and seemed at first quite engrossed in herself but\\nthen she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her\\nfingers spread shouting Help for pitys sake Help  The way she\\nheld her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better but the\\nunthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not\\nshe had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the\\nbreakfast things on it when she reached the table she sat quickly\\ndown on it without knowing what she was doing without even seeming\\nto notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of\\ncoffee was pouring down onto the carpet\\n\\n\\nMother mother said Gregor gently looking up at her  He had\\ncompletely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment but could not\\nhelp himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the\\nflow of coffee  That set his mother screaming anew she fled from\\nthe table and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her\\nGregor though had no time to spare for his parents now the chief\\nclerk had already reached the stairs with his chin on the banister\\nhe looked back for the last time  Gregor made a run for him he\\nwanted to be sure of reaching him the chief clerk must have\\nexpected something as he leapt down several steps at once and\\ndisappeared his shouts resounding all around the staircase  The\\nflight of the chief clerk seemed unfortunately to put Gregors\\nfather into a panic as well  Until then he had been relatively self\\ncontrolled but now instead of running after the chief clerk\\nhimself or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him\\nGregors father seized the chief clerks stick in his right hand\\nthe chief clerk had left it behind on a chair along with his hat\\nand overcoat picked up a large newspaper from the table with his\\nleft and used them to drive Gregor back into his room stamping his\\nfoot at him as he went  Gregors appeals to his father were of no\\nhelp his appeals were simply not understood however much he humbly\\nturned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder\\nAcross the room despite the chilly weather Gregors mother had\\npulled open a window leant far out of it and pressed her hands to\\nher face  A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards\\nthe stairway the curtains flew up the newspapers on the table\\nfluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor  Nothing would\\nstop Gregors father as he drove him back making hissing noises at\\nhim like a wild man  Gregor had never had any practice in moving\\nbackwards and was only able to go very slowly  If Gregor had only\\nbeen allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room\\nstraight away but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that\\nhis father would become impatient and there was the threat of a\\nlethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his fathers hand\\nany moment  Eventually though Gregor realised that he had no\\nchoice as he saw to his disgust that he was quite incapable of\\ngoing backwards in a straight line so he began as quickly as\\npossible and with frequent anxious glances at his father to turn\\nhimself round  It went very slowly but perhaps his father was able\\nto see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him in fact\\nnow and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a\\ndistance as to which way to turn  If only his father would stop\\nthat unbearable hissing It was making Gregor quite confused  When\\nhe had nearly finished turning round still listening to that\\nhissing he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way\\nhe had just come  He was pleased when he finally had his head in\\nfront of the doorway but then saw that it was too narrow and his\\nbody was too broad to get through it without further difficulty  In\\nhis present mood it obviously did not occur to his father to open\\nthe other of the double doors so that Gregor would have enough space\\nto get through  He was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should\\nbe got back into his room as quickly as possible  Nor would he ever\\nhave allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation\\nfor getting through the doorway  What he did making more noise\\nthan ever was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if there\\nhad been nothing in the way it sounded to Gregor as if there was\\nnow more than one father behind him it was not a pleasant\\nexperience and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without\\nregard for what might happen  One side of his body lifted itself\\nhe lay at an angle in the doorway one flank scraped on the white\\ndoor and was painfully injured leaving vile brown flecks on it\\nsoon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all\\nby himself the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air\\nwhile those on the other side were pressed painfully against the\\nground  Then his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which\\nreleased him from where he was held and sent him flying and heavily\\nbleeding deep into his room  The door was slammed shut with the\\nstick then finally all was quiet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke\\nfrom his deep and comalike sleep  He would have woken soon\\nafterwards anyway even if he hadnt been disturbed as he had had\\nenough sleep and felt fully rested  But he had the impression that\\nsome hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front\\nroom being carefully shut had woken him  The light from the\\nelectric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling\\nand tops of the furniture but down below where Gregor was it was\\ndark  He pushed himself over to the door feeling his way clumsily\\nwith his antennae  of which he was now beginning to learn the value\\n in order to see what had been happening there  The whole of his\\nleft side seemed like one painfully stretched scar  and he limped\\nbadly on his two rows of legs  One of the legs had been badly\\ninjured in the events of that morning  it was nearly a miracle that\\nonly one of them had been  and dragged along lifelessly\\n\\n\\nIt was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it\\nactually was that had drawn him over to it it was the smell of\\nsomething to eat  By the door there was a dish filled with\\nsweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it  He\\nwas so pleased he almost laughed as he was even hungrier than he\\nhad been that morning and immediately dipped his head into the\\nmilk nearly covering his eyes with it  But he soon drew his head\\nback again in disappointment not only did the pain in his tender\\nleft side make it difficult to eat the food  he was only able to\\neat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole  but the\\nmilk did not taste at all nice  Milk like this was normally his\\nfavourite drink and his sister had certainly left it there for him\\nbecause of that but he turned almost against his own will away\\nfrom the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room\\n\\n\\nThrough the crack in the door Gregor could see that the gas had\\nbeen lit in the living room  His father at this time would normally\\nbe sat with his evening paper reading it out in a loud voice to\\nGregors mother and sometimes to his sister but there was now not\\na sound to be heard  Gregors sister would often write and tell him\\nabout this reading but maybe his father had lost the habit in\\nrecent times  It was so quiet all around too even though there\\nmust have been somebody in the flat  What a quiet life it is the\\nfamily lead said Gregor to himself and gazing into the darkness\\nfelt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in\\nsuch a nice home for his sister and parents  But what now if all\\nthis peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and\\nfrightening end That was something that Gregor did not want to\\nthink about too much so he started to move about crawling up and\\ndown the room\\n\\n\\nOnce during that long evening the door on one side of the room was\\nopened very slightly and hurriedly closed again later on the door\\non the other side did the same it seemed that someone needed to\\nenter the room but thought better of it  Gregor went and waited\\nimmediately by the door resolved either to bring the timorous\\nvisitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it\\nwas but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited in\\nvain  The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had\\nwanted to get in there to him but now now that he had opened up\\none of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time\\nduring the day noone came and the keys were in the other sides\\n\\n\\nIt was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room\\nwas put out and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had\\nstayed awake all that time as they all could be distinctly heard as\\nthey went away together on tiptoe  It was clear that noone would\\ncome into Gregors room any more until morning that gave him plenty\\nof time to think undisturbed about how he would have to rearrange\\nhis life  For some reason the tall empty room where he was forced\\nto remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor\\neven though he had been living in it for five years  Hardly aware\\nof what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame he\\nhurried under the couch  It pressed down on his back a little and\\nhe was no longer able to lift his head but he nonetheless felt\\nimmediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was too\\nbroad to get it all underneath\\n\\n\\nHe spent the whole night there  Some of the time he passed in a\\nlight sleep although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of\\nhis hunger and some of the time was spent in worries and vague\\nhopes which however always led to the same conclusion for the\\ntime being he must remain calm he must show patience and the\\ngreatest consideration so that his family could bear the\\nunpleasantness that he in his present condition was forced to\\nimpose on them\\n\\n\\nGregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his\\ndecisions as early the next morning almost before the night had\\nended his sister nearly fully dressed opened the door from the\\nfront room and looked anxiously in  She did not see him straight\\naway but when she did notice him under the couch  he had to be\\nsomewhere for Gods sake he couldnt have flown away  she was so\\nshocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut\\nagain from outside  But she seemed to regret her behaviour as she\\nopened the door again straight away and came in on tiptoe as if\\nentering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger\\nGregor had pushed his head forward right to the edge of the couch\\nand watched her  Would she notice that he had left the milk as it\\nwas realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring him\\nin some other food that was more suitable If she didnt do it\\nherself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it\\nalthough he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the\\ncouch throw himself at his sisters feet and beg her for something\\ngood to eat  However his sister noticed the full dish immediately\\nand looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with\\nsome surprise  She immediately picked it up  using a rag\\nnot her bare hands  and carried it out  Gregor was extremely\\ncurious as to what she would bring in its place imagining the\\nwildest possibilities but he never could have guessed what his\\nsister in her goodness actually did bring  In order to test his\\ntaste she brought him a whole selection of things all spread out\\non an old newspaper  There were old halfrotten vegetables bones\\nfrom the evening meal covered in white sauce that had gone hard a\\nfew raisins and almonds some cheese that Gregor had declared\\ninedible two days before a dry roll and some bread spread with\\nbutter and salt  As well as all that she had poured some water into\\nthe dish which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregors\\nuse and placed it beside them  Then out of consideration for\\nGregors feelings as she knew that he would not eat in front of\\nher she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so\\nthat Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for\\nhimself as he liked  Gregors little legs whirred at last he could\\neat  Whats more his injuries must already have completely healed\\nas he found no difficulty in moving  This amazed him as more than\\na month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife he\\nthought of how his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday\\nAm I less sensitive than I used to be then he thought and was\\nalready sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately almost\\ncompellingly attracted him much more than the other foods on the\\nnewspaper  Quickly one after another his eyes watering with\\npleasure he consumed the cheese the vegetables and the sauce the\\nfresh foods on the other hand he didnt like at all and even\\ndragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them\\nbecause he couldnt stand the smell  Long after he had finished\\neating and lay lethargic in the same place his sister slowly turned\\nthe key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw  He\\nwas immediately startled although he had been half asleep and he\\nhurried back under the couch  But he needed great selfcontrol to\\nstay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room\\nas eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he\\ncould hardly breathe in that narrow space  Half suffocating he\\nwatched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a\\nbroom and swept up the leftovers mixing them in with the food he\\nhad not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more\\nShe quickly dropped it all into a bin closed it with its wooden\\nlid and carried everything out  She had hardly turned her back\\nbefore Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretched\\nhimself\\n\\n\\nThis was how Gregor received his food each day now once in the\\nmorning while his parents and the maid were still asleep and the\\nsecond time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his\\nparents would sleep for a little while then as well and Gregors\\nsister would send the maid away on some errand  Gregors father and\\nmother certainly did not want him to starve either but perhaps it\\nwould have been more than they could stand to have any more\\nexperience of his feeding than being told about it and perhaps his\\nsister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were\\nindeed suffering enough\\n\\n\\nIt was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the\\ndoctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the\\nflat  As nobody could understand him nobody not even his sister\\nthought that he could understand them so he had to be content to\\nhear his sisters sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about\\nhis room  It was only later when she had become a little more used\\nto everything  there was of course no question of her ever\\nbecoming fully used to the situation  that Gregor would sometimes\\ncatch a friendly comment or at least a comment that could be\\nconstrued as friendly  Hes enjoyed his dinner today she might\\nsay when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him\\nor if he left most of it which slowly became more and more\\nfrequent she would often say sadly now everythings just been\\nleft there again\\n\\n\\nAlthough Gregor wasnt able to hear any news directly he did listen\\nto much of what was said in the next rooms and whenever he heard\\nanyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and\\npress his whole body against it  There was seldom any conversation\\nespecially at first that was not about him in some way even if\\nonly in secret  For two whole days all the talk at every mealtime\\nwas about what they should do now but even between meals they spoke\\nabout the same subject as there were always at least two members of\\nthe family at home  nobody wanted to be at home by themselves and\\nit was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty  And on\\nthe very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged\\nGregors mother to let her go without delay  It was not very clear\\nhow much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter\\nof an hour tearfully thanking Gregors mother for her dismissal as\\nif she had done her an enormous service  She even swore\\nemphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had\\nhappened even though noone had asked that of her\\n\\n\\nNow Gregors sister also had to help his mother with the cooking\\nalthough that was not so much bother as noone ate very much\\nGregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another\\nto eat and receive no more answer than no thanks Ive had enough\\nor something similar  Noone drank very much either  His sister\\nwould sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer hoping\\nfor the chance to go and fetch it herself  When his father then\\nsaid nothing she would add so that he would not feel selfish that\\nshe could send the housekeeper for it but then his father would\\nclose the matter with a big loud No and no more would be said\\n\\n\\nEven before the first day had come to an end his father had\\nexplained to Gregors mother and sister what their finances and\\nprospects were  Now and then he stood up from the table and took\\nsome receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved from\\nhis business when it had collapsed five years earlier  Gregor heard\\nhow he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he\\nhad taken the item he wanted  What he heard his father say was some\\nof the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first been\\nincarcerated in his room  He had thought that nothing at all\\nremained from his fathers business at least he had never told him\\nanything different and Gregor had never asked him about it anyway\\nTheir business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total\\ndespair and Gregors only concern at that time had been to arrange\\nthings so that they could all forget about it as quickly as\\npossible  So then he started working especially hard with a fiery\\nvigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling\\nrepresentative almost overnight bringing with it the chance to earn\\nmoney in quite different ways  Gregor converted his success at work\\nstraight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the\\nbenefit of his astonished and delighted family  They had been good\\ntimes and they had never come again at least not with the same\\nsplendour even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was\\nin a position to bear the costs of the whole family and did bear\\nthem  They had even got used to it both Gregor and the family\\nthey took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it\\nalthough there was no longer much warm affection given in return\\nGregor only remained close to his sister now  Unlike him she was\\nvery fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist it was his\\nsecret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though it\\nwould cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some\\nother way  During Gregors short periods in town conversation with\\nhis sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever\\nmentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised  Their\\nparents did not like to hear this innocent talk but Gregor thought\\nabout it quite hard and decided he would let them know what he\\nplanned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day\\n\\n\\nThat was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his\\nmind in his present state pressed upright against the door and\\nlistening  There were times when he simply became too tired to\\ncontinue listening when his head would fall wearily against the\\ndoor and he would pull it up again with a start as even the\\nslightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would\\nall go silent  Whats that hes doing now his father would say\\nafter a while clearly having gone over to the door and only then\\nwould the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again\\n\\n\\nWhen explaining things his father repeated himself several times\\npartly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with\\nthese matters himself and partly because Gregors mother did not\\nunderstand everything the first time  From these repeated explanations\\nGregor learned to his pleasure that despite all their misfortunes\\nthere was still some money available from the old days  It was not\\na lot but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest\\nhad accumulated  Besides that they had not been using up all the\\nmoney that Gregor had been bringing home every month keeping only a\\nlittle for himself so that that too had been accumulating\\nBehind the door Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at\\nthis unexpected thrift and caution  He could actually have used\\nthis surplus money to reduce his fathers debt to his boss and the\\nday when he could have freed himself from that job would have come\\nmuch closer but now it was certainly better the way his father had\\ndone things\\n\\n\\nThis money however was certainly not enough to enable the family\\nto live off the interest it was enough to maintain them for\\nperhaps one or two years no more  Thats to say it was money\\nthat should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies\\nmoney to live on had to be earned  His father was healthy but old\\nand lacking in self confidence  During the five years that he had\\nnot been working  the first holiday in a life that had been full of\\nstrain and no success  he had put on a lot of weight and become\\nvery slow and clumsy  Would Gregors elderly mother now have to go\\nand earn money She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her\\njust to move about the home every other day would be spent\\nstruggling for breath on the sofa by the open window  Would his\\nsister have to go and earn money She was still a child of\\nseventeen her life up till then had been very enviable consisting\\nof wearing nice clothes sleeping late helping out in the business\\njoining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the\\nviolin  Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money\\nGregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself\\nonto the cool leather sofa next to it as he became quite hot with\\nshame and regret\\n\\n\\nHe would often lie there the whole night through not sleeping a\\nwink but scratching at the leather for hours on end  Or he might go\\nto all the effort of pushing a chair to the window climbing up onto\\nthe sill and propped up in the chair leaning on the window to\\nstare out of it  He had used to feel a great sense of freedom from\\ndoing this but doing it now was obviously something more remembered\\nthan experienced  as what he actually saw in this way was becoming\\nless distinct every day even things that were quite near he had\\nused to curse the everpresent view of the hospital across the\\nstreet but now he could not see it at all and if he had not known\\nthat he lived in Charlottenstrasse which was a quiet street despite\\nbeing in the middle of the city he could have thought that he was\\nlooking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the\\ngrey earth mingled inseparably  His observant sister only needed to\\nnotice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its\\nexact position by the window after she had tidied up the room and\\neven left the inner pane of the window open from then on\\n\\n\\nIf Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her\\nfor all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him\\nto bear it but as it was it caused him pain  His sister\\nnaturally tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing\\nburdensome about it and the longer it went on of course the\\nbetter she was able to do so but as time went by Gregor was also\\nable to see through it all so much better  It had even become very\\nunpleasant for him now whenever she entered the room  No sooner\\nhad she come in than she would quickly close the door as a\\nprecaution so that noone would have to suffer the view into\\nGregors room then she would go straight to the window and pull it\\nhurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating  Even if it was\\ncold she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little\\nwhile  She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about\\nand noise making he would stay under the couch shivering the whole\\nwhile knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to\\nspare him this ordeal but it was impossible for her to be in the\\nsame room with him with the windows closed\\n\\n\\nOne day about a month after Gregors transformation when his sister\\nno longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance\\nshe came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him\\nstill staring out the window motionless and just where he would be\\nmost horrible  In itself his sisters not coming into the room\\nwould have been no surprise for Gregor as it would have been\\ndifficult for her to immediately open the window while he was still\\nthere but not only did she not come in she went straight back and\\nclosed the door behind her a stranger would have thought he had\\nthreatened her and tried to bite her  Gregor went straight to hide\\nhimself under the couch of course but he had to wait until midday\\nbefore his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than\\nusual  It made him realise that she still found his appearance\\nunbearable and would continue to do so she probably even had to\\novercome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that\\nprotruded from under the couch  One day in order to spare her even\\nthis sight he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the\\ncouch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered\\nand his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down\\nIf she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do\\nwas take it off again as it was clear enough that it was no\\npleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely  She left the\\nsheet where it was  Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of\\ngratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet\\nto see how his sister liked the new arrangement\\n\\n\\nFor the first fourteen days Gregors parents could not bring\\nthemselves to come into the room to see him  He would often hear\\nthem say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing\\neven though before they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat\\nuseless and frequently been annoyed with her  But now the two of\\nthem father and mother would often both wait outside the door of\\nGregors room while his sister tidied up in there and as soon as\\nshe went out again she would have to tell them exactly how\\neverything looked what Gregor had eaten how he had behaved this\\ntime and whether perhaps any slight improvement could be seen\\nHis mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon but\\nhis father and sister at first persuaded her against it  Gregor\\nlistened very closely to all this and approved fully  Later\\nthough she had to be held back by force which made her call out\\nLet me go and see Gregor he is my unfortunate son Cant you\\nunderstand I have to see him and Gregor would think to himself\\nthat maybe it would be better if his mother came in not every day\\nof course but one day a week perhaps she could understand\\neverything much better than his sister who for all her courage was\\nstill just a child after all and really might not have had an\\nadults appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on\\n\\n\\nGregors wish to see his mother was soon realised  Out of\\nconsideration for his parents Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at\\nthe window during the day the few square meters of the floor did\\nnot give him much room to crawl about it was hard to just lie\\nquietly through the night his food soon stopped giving him any\\npleasure at all and so to entertain himself he got into the habit\\nof crawling up and down the walls and ceiling  He was especially\\nfond of hanging from the ceiling it was quite different from lying\\non the floor he could breathe more freely his body had a light\\nswing to it and up there relaxed and almost happy it might happen\\nthat he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling and\\nlanding on the floor with a crash  But now of course he had far\\nbetter control of his body than before and even with a fall as\\ngreat as that caused himself no damage  Very soon his sister\\nnoticed Gregors new way of entertaining himself  he had after\\nall left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about \\nand got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by\\nremoving the furniture that got in his way especially the chest of\\ndrawers and the desk  Now this was not something that she would be\\nable to do by herself she did not dare to ask for help from her\\nfather the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the\\ncook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this she\\nhad even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times\\nand never to have to open the door unless it was especially\\nimportant so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when\\nGregors father was not there and fetch his mother to help her  As\\nshe approached the room Gregor could hear his mother express her\\njoy but once at the door she went silent  First of course his\\nsister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room\\nwas alright and only then did she let her mother enter  Gregor had\\nhurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more\\nfolds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just\\nbeen thrown down by chance  Gregor also refrained this time from\\nspying out from under the sheet he gave up the chance to see his\\nmother until later and was simply glad that she had come  You can\\ncome in he cant be seen said his sister obviously leading her\\nin by the hand  The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair\\nof feeble women to be heaving about but Gregor listened as they\\npushed it from its place his sister always taking on the heaviest\\npart of the work for herself and ignoring her mothers warnings that\\nshe would strain herself  This lasted a very long time  After\\nlabouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would\\nbe better to leave the chest where it was for one thing it was too\\nheavy for them to get the job finished before Gregors father got\\nhome and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way\\neven more and for another thing it wasnt even sure that taking the\\nfurniture away would really be any help to him  She thought just\\nthe opposite the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her\\nheart and why wouldnt Gregor feel the same way about it hed been\\nused to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make\\nhim feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that  Then quietly\\nalmost whispering as if wanting Gregor whose whereabouts she did\\nnot know to hear not even the tone of her voice as she was\\nconvinced that he did not understand her words she added and by\\ntaking the furniture away wont it seem like were showing that\\nweve given up all hope of improvement and were abandoning him to\\ncope for himself I think itd be best to leave the room exactly the\\nway it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again hell\\nfind everything unchanged and hell be able to forget the time in\\nbetween all the easier\\n\\n\\nHearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the\\nlack of any direct human communication along with the monotonous\\nlife led by the family during these two months must have made him\\nconfused  he could think of no other way of explaining to himself\\nwhy he had seriously wanted his room emptied out  Had he really\\nwanted to transform his room into a cave a warm room fitted out\\nwith the nice furniture he had inherited That would have let him\\ncrawl around unimpeded in any direction but it would also have let\\nhim quickly forget his past when he had still been human  He had\\ncome very close to forgetting and it had only been the voice of his\\nmother unheard for so long that had shaken him out of it  Nothing\\nshould be removed everything had to stay he could not do without\\nthe good influence the furniture had on his condition and if the\\nfurniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that\\nwas not a loss but a great advantage\\n\\n\\nHis sister unfortunately did not agree she had become used to the\\nidea not without reason that she was Gregors spokesman to his\\nparents about the things that concerned him  This meant that his\\nmothers advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on\\nremoving not only the chest of drawers and the desk as she had\\nthought at first but all the furniture apart from the allimportant\\ncouch  It was more than childish perversity of course or the\\nunexpected confidence she had recently acquired that made her\\ninsist she had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to\\ncrawl about in whereas the furniture as far as anyone could see\\nwas of no use to him at all  Girls of that age though do become\\nenthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way whenever\\nthey can  Perhaps this was what tempted Grete to make Gregors\\nsituation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could do\\neven more for him  Grete would probably be the only one who would\\ndare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling about the bare walls\\nby himself\\n\\n\\nSo she refused to let her mother dissuade her  Gregors mother\\nalready looked uneasy in his room she soon stopped speaking and\\nhelped Gregors sister to get the chest of drawers out with what\\nstrength she had  The chest of drawers was something that Gregor\\ncould do without if he had to but the writing desk had to stay\\nHardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers groaning out\\nof the room than Gregor poked his head out from under the couch to\\nsee what he could do about it  He meant to be as careful and\\nconsiderate as he could but unfortunately it was his mother who\\ncame back first while Grete in the next room had her arms round the\\nchest pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself\\nwithout of course moving it an inch  His mother was not used to\\nthe sight of Gregor he might have made her ill so Gregor hurried\\nbackwards to the far end of the couch  In his startlement though\\nhe was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a\\nlittle  It was enough to attract his mothers attention  She stood\\nvery still remained there a moment and then went back out to\\nGrete\\n\\n\\nGregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was\\nhappening it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after\\nall but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro their\\nlittle calls to each other the scraping of the furniture on the\\nfloor all these things made him feel as if he were being assailed\\nfrom all sides  With his head and legs pulled in against him and\\nhis body pressed to the floor he was forced to admit to himself\\nthat he could not stand all of this much longer  They were emptying\\nhis room out taking away everything that was dear to him they had\\nalready taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools\\nnow they threatened to remove the writing desk with its place\\nclearly worn into the floor the desk where he had done his homework\\nas a business trainee at high school even while he had been at\\ninfant schoolhe really could not wait any longer to see whether\\nthe two womens intentions were good  He had nearly forgotten they\\nwere there anyway as they were now too tired to say anything while\\nthey worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped\\nheavily on the floor\\n\\n\\nSo while the women were leant against the desk in the other room\\ncatching their breath he sallied out changed direction four times\\nnot knowing what he should save first before his attention was\\nsuddenly caught by the picture on the wall  which was already\\ndenuded of everything else that had been on it  of the lady dressed\\nin copious fur  He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself\\nagainst its glass it held him firmly and felt good on his hot\\nbelly  This picture at least now totally covered by Gregor would\\ncertainly be taken away by noone  He turned his head to face the\\ndoor into the living room so that he could watch the women when they\\ncame back\\n\\n\\nThey had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite\\nsoon Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly\\ncarrying her  What shall we take now then said Grete and\\nlooked around  Her eyes met those of Gregor on the wall  Perhaps\\nonly because her mother was there she remained calm bent her face\\nto her so that she would not look round and said albeit hurriedly\\nand with a tremor in her voice Come on lets go back in the\\nliving room for a while  Gregor could see what Grete had in mind\\nshe wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down\\nfrom the wall  Well she could certainly try it He sat unyielding\\non his picture  He would rather jump at Gretes face\\n\\n\\nBut Gretes words had made her mother quite worried she stepped to\\none side saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the\\nwallpaper and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw\\nscreamed Oh God oh God  Arms outstretched she fell onto the\\ncouch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile\\nGregor shouted his sister glowering at him and shaking her fist\\n That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his\\ntransformation  She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of\\nsmelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint Gregor wanted\\nto help too  he could save his picture later although he stuck\\nfast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force then he\\ntoo ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in\\nthe old days but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing she\\nwas looking into various bottles he startled her when she turned\\nround a bottle fell to the ground and broke a splinter cut\\nGregors face some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him\\nnow without delaying any longer Grete took hold of all the bottles\\nshe could and ran with them in to her mother she slammed the door\\nshut with her foot  So now Gregor was shut out from his mother\\nwho because of him might be near to death he could not open the\\ndoor if he did not want to chase his sister away and she had to\\nstay with his mother there was nothing for him to do but wait and\\noppressed with anxiety and selfreproach he began to crawl about\\nhe crawled over everything walls furniture ceiling and finally\\nin his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell\\ndown into the middle of the dinner table\\n\\n\\nHe lay there for a while numb and immobile all around him it was\\nquiet maybe that was a good sign  Then there was someone at the\\ndoor  The maid of course had locked herself in her kitchen so\\nthat Grete would have to go and answer it  His father had arrived\\nhome  Whats happened were his first words Gretes appearance\\nmust have made everything clear to him  She answered him with\\nsubdued voice and openly pressed her face into his chest Mothers\\nfainted but shes better now  Gregor got out  Just as I\\nexpected said his father just as I always said but you women\\nwouldnt listen would you  It was clear to Gregor that Grete had\\nnot said enough and that his father took it to mean that something\\nbad had happened that he was responsible for some act of violence\\nThat meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father as he\\ndid not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been\\npossible  So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself\\nagainst it so that his father when he came in from the hall could\\nsee straight away that Gregor had the best intentions and would go\\nback into his room without delay that it would not be necessary to\\ndrive him back but that they had only to open the door and he would\\ndisappear\\n\\n\\nHis father though was not in the mood to notice subtleties like\\nthat Ah he shouted as he came in sounding as if he were both\\nangry and glad at the same time  Gregor drew his head back from the\\ndoor and lifted it towards his father  He really had not imagined\\nhis father the way he stood there now of late with his new habit\\nof crawling about he had neglected to pay attention to what was\\ngoing on the rest of the flat the way he had done before  He really\\nought to have expected things to have changed but still still was\\nthat really his father The same tired man as used to be laying\\nthere entombed in his bed when Gregor came back from his business\\ntrips who would receive him sitting in the armchair in his\\nnightgown when he came back in the evenings who was hardly even\\nable to stand up but as a sign of his pleasure would just raise\\nhis arms and who on the couple of times a year when they went for a\\nwalk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in\\nhis overcoat between Gregor and his mother would always labour his\\nway forward a little more slowly than them who were already walking\\nslowly for his sake who would place his stick down carefully and\\nif he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his\\ncompanions around him  He was standing up straight enough now\\ndressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons the sort worn by\\nthe employees at the banking institute above the high stiff collar\\nof the coat his strong doublechin emerged under the bushy\\neyebrows his piercing dark eyes looked out fresh and alert his\\nnormally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his\\nscalp  He took his cap with its gold monogram from probably some\\nbank and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa\\nput his hands in his trouser pockets pushing back the bottom of his\\nlong uniform coat and with look of determination walked towards\\nGregor  He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind\\nbut nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high  Gregor was amazed\\nat the enormous size of the soles of his boots but wasted no time\\nwith that  he knew full well right from the first day of his new\\nlife that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely\\nstrict with him  And so he ran up to his father stopped when his\\nfather stopped scurried forwards again when he moved even\\nslightly  In this way they went round the room several times\\nwithout anything decisive happening without even giving the\\nimpression of a chase as everything went so slowly  Gregor remained\\nall this time on the floor largely because he feared his father\\nmight see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or\\nceiling  Whatever he did Gregor had to admit that he certainly\\nwould not be able to keep up this running about for long as for\\neach step his father took he had to carry out countless movements\\nHe became noticeably short of breath even in his earlier life his\\nlungs had not been very reliable  Now as he lurched about in his\\nefforts to muster all the strength he could for running he could\\nhardly keep his eyes open his thoughts became too slow for him to\\nthink of any other way of saving himself than running he almost\\nforgot that the walls were there for him to use although here they\\nwere concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and\\nprotrusions  then right beside him lightly tossed something flew\\ndown and rolled in front of him  It was an apple then another one\\nimmediately flew at him Gregor froze in shock there was no longer\\nany point in running as his father had decided to bombard him  He\\nhad filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and\\nnow without even taking the time for careful aim threw one apple\\nafter another  These little red apples rolled about on the floor\\nknocking into each other as if they had electric motors  An apple\\nthrown without much force glanced against Gregors back and slid off\\nwithout doing any harm  Another one however immediately following\\nit hit squarely and lodged in his back Gregor wanted to drag\\nhimself away as if he could remove the surprising the incredible\\npain by changing his position but he felt as if nailed to the spot\\nand spread himself out all his senses in confusion  The last thing\\nhe saw was the door of his room being pulled open his sister was\\nscreaming his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse as his\\nsister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted to\\nmake it easier for her to breathe she ran to his father her\\nskirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground\\nstumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father her arms\\naround him uniting herself with him totally  now Gregor lost his\\nability to see anything  her hands behind his fathers head begging\\nhim to spare Gregors life\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNoone dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregors flesh so it\\nremained there as a visible reminder of his injury  He had suffered\\nit there for more than a month and his condition seemed serious\\nenough to remind even his father that Gregor despite his current\\nsad and revolting form was a family member who could not be treated\\nas an enemy  On the contrary as a family there was a duty to\\nswallow any revulsion for him and to be patient just to be patient\\n\\n\\nBecause of his injuries Gregor had lost much of his mobility \\nprobably permanently  He had been reduced to the condition of an\\nancient invalid and it took him long long minutes to crawl across\\nhis room  crawling over the ceiling was out of the question  but\\nthis deterioration in his condition was fully in his opinion made\\nup for by the door to the living room being left open every evening\\n He got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours\\nbefore it was opened and then lying in the darkness of his room\\nwhere he could not be seen from the living room he could watch the\\nfamily in the light of the dinner table and listen to their\\nconversation  with everyones permission in a way and thus quite\\ndifferently from before\\n\\n\\nThey no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times of\\ncourse the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when\\nhe was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room\\n All of them were usually very quiet nowadays  Soon after dinner\\nhis father would go to sleep in his chair his mother and sister\\nwould urge each other to be quiet his mother bent deeply under the\\nlamp would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop his sister who\\nhad taken a sales job learned shorthand and French in the evenings\\nso that she might be able to get a better position later on\\nSometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregors mother\\nyoure doing so much sewing again today as if he did not know\\nthat he had been dozing  and then he would go back to sleep again\\nwhile mother and sister would exchange a tired grin\\n\\n\\nWith a kind of stubbornness Gregors father refused to take his\\nuniform off even at home while his nightgown hung unused on its peg\\nGregors father would slumber where he was fully dressed as if\\nalways ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his\\nsuperior even here  The uniform had not been new to start with but\\nas a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the\\nefforts of Gregors mother and sister to look after it  Gregor\\nwould often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on\\nthis coat with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny\\nwhile the old man in it would sleep highly uncomfortable but\\npeaceful\\n\\n\\nAs soon as it struck ten Gregors mother would speak gently to his\\nfather to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed as he\\ncouldnt sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his\\nsleep if he was to be up at six to get to work  But since he had\\nbeen in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on\\nstaying longer at the table even though he regularly fell asleep\\nand it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the\\nchair for his bed  Then however much mother and sister would\\nimportune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep\\nslowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes\\nclosed and refusing to get up  Gregors mother would tug at his\\nsleeve whisper endearments into his ear Gregors sister would\\nleave her work to help her mother but nothing would have any effect\\non him  He would just sink deeper into his chair  Only when the\\ntwo women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes\\nlook at them one after the other and say What a life This is what\\npeace I get in my old age  And supported by the two women he would\\nlift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load\\nhimself let the women take him to the door send them off and carry\\non by himself while Gregors mother would throw down her needle and\\nhis sister her pen so that they could run after his father and\\ncontinue being of help to him\\n\\n\\nWho in this tired and overworked family would have had time to\\ngive more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary The\\nhousehold budget became even smaller so now the maid was dismissed\\nan enormous thickboned charwoman with white hair that flapped\\naround her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest\\nwork everything else was looked after by Gregors mother on top of\\nthe large amount of sewing work she did  Gregor even learned\\nlistening to the evening conversation about what price they had\\nhoped for that several items of jewellery belonging to the family\\nhad been sold even though both mother and sister had been very fond\\nof wearing them at functions and celebrations  But the loudest\\ncomplaint was that although the flat was much too big for their\\npresent circumstances they could not move out of it there was no\\nimaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address  He could\\nsee quite well though that there were more reasons than\\nconsideration for him that made it difficult for them to move it\\nwould have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate\\nwith a few air holes in it the main thing holding the family back\\nfrom their decision to move was much more to do with their total\\ndespair and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune\\nunlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related\\nto  They carried out absolutely everything that the world expects\\nfrom poor people Gregors father brought bank employees their\\nbreakfast his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for\\nstrangers his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the\\nbehest of the customers but they just did not have the strength to\\ndo any more  And the injury in Gregors back began to hurt as much\\nas when it was new  After they had come back from taking his father\\nto bed Gregors mother and sister would now leave their work where\\nit was and sit close together cheek to cheek his mother would\\npoint to Gregors room and say Close that door Grete and then\\nwhen he was in the dark again they would sit in the next room and\\ntheir tears would mingle or they would simply sit there staring\\ndryeyed at the table\\n\\n\\nGregor hardly slept at all either night or day  Sometimes he would\\nthink of taking over the familys affairs just like before the\\nnext time the door was opened he had long forgotten about his boss\\nand the chief clerk but they would appear again in his thoughts\\nthe salesmen and the apprentices that stupid teaboy two or three\\nfriends from other businesses one of the chambermaids from a\\nprovincial hotel a tender memory that appeared and disappeared\\nagain a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been\\nserious but too slow  all of them appeared to him mixed together\\nwith strangers and others he had forgotten but instead of helping\\nhim and his family they were all of them inaccessible and he was\\nglad when they disappeared  Other times he was not at all in the\\nmood to look after his family he was filled with simple rage about\\nthe lack of attention he was shown and although he could think of\\nnothing he would have wanted he made plans of how he could get into\\nthe pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to\\neven if he was not hungry  Gregors sister no longer thought about\\nhow she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other\\ninto his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the\\nmorning and at midday and in the evening she would sweep it away\\nagain with the broom indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or\\n more often than not  had been left totally untouched  She still\\ncleared up the room in the evening but now she could not have been\\nany quicker about it  Smears of dirt were left on the walls here\\nand there were little balls of dust and filth  At first Gregor\\nwent into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived\\nas a reproach to her but he could have stayed there for weeks\\nwithout his sister doing anything about it she could see the dirt\\nas well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it\\nAt the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for\\nher and which everyone in the family understood  cleaning up\\nGregors room was for her and her alone  Gregors mother did once\\nthoroughly clean his room and needed to use several bucketfuls of\\nwater to do it  although that much dampness also made Gregor ill\\nand he lay flat on the couch bitter and immobile  But his mother\\nwas to be punished still more for what she had done as hardly had\\nhis sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change\\nin Gregors room and highly aggrieved ran back into the living\\nroom where despite her mothers raised and imploring hands she\\nbroke into convulsive tears  Her father of course was startled\\nout of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished and\\nhelpless then they too became agitated Gregors father standing\\nto the right of his mother accused her of not leaving the cleaning\\nof Gregors room to his sister from her left Gregors sister\\nscreamed at her that she was never to clean Gregors room again\\nwhile his mother tried to draw his father who was beside himself\\nwith anger into the bedroom his sister quaking with tears\\nthumped on the table with her small fists and Gregor hissed in\\nanger that noone had even thought of closing the door to save him\\nthe sight of this and all its noise\\n\\n\\nGregors sister was exhausted from going out to work and looking\\nafter Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her but\\neven so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place\\nGregor on the other hand ought not to be neglected  Now though\\nthe charwoman was here  This elderly widow with a robust bone\\nstructure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things in\\nher long life wasnt really repelled by Gregor  Just by chance one\\nday rather than any real curiosity she opened the door to Gregors\\nroom and found herself face to face with him  He was taken totally\\nby surprise noone was chasing him but he began to rush to and fro\\nwhile she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in\\nfront of her  From then on she never failed to open the door\\nslightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him  At\\nfirst she would call to him as she did so with words that she\\nprobably considered friendly such as come on then you old\\ndungbeetle or look at the old dungbeetle there  Gregor never\\nresponded to being spoken to in that way but just remained where he\\nwas without moving as if the door had never even been opened  If\\nonly they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every day\\ninstead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt\\nlike it One day early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the\\nwindowpanes perhaps indicating that spring was coming she began to\\nspeak to him in that way once again  Gregor was so resentful of it\\nthat he started to move toward her he was slow and infirm but it\\nwas like a kind of attack  Instead of being afraid the charwoman\\njust lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there\\nwith her mouth open clearly intending not to close her mouth until\\nthe chair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregors back\\nArent you coming any closer then she asked when Gregor turned\\nround again and she calmly put the chair back in the corner\\n\\n\\nGregor had almost entirely stopped eating  Only if he happened to\\nfind himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he\\nmight take some of it into his mouth to play with it leave it there\\na few hours and then more often than not spit it out again  At\\nfirst he thought it was distress at the state of his room that\\nstopped him eating but he had soon got used to the changes made\\nthere  They had got into the habit of putting things into this room\\nthat they had no room for anywhere else and there were now many\\nsuch things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to\\nthree gentlemen  These earnest gentlemen  all three of them had\\nfull beards as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door\\none day  were painfully insistent on things being tidy  This\\nmeant not only in their own room but since they had taken a room in\\nthis establishment in the entire flat and especially in the\\nkitchen  Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate\\nespecially if it was dirty  They had moreover brought most of their\\nown furnishings and equipment with them  For this reason many\\nthings had become superfluous which although they could not be\\nsold the family did not wish to discard  All these things found\\ntheir way into Gregors room  The dustbins from the kitchen found\\ntheir way in there too  The charwoman was always in a hurry and\\nanything she couldnt use for the time being she would just chuck in\\nthere  He fortunately would usually see no more than the object\\nand the hand that held it  The woman most likely meant to fetch the\\nthings back out again when she had time and the opportunity or to\\nthrow everything out in one go but what actually happened was that\\nthey were left where they landed when they had first been thrown\\nunless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere\\nelse  At first he moved it because with no other room free where\\nhe could crawl about he was forced to but later on he came to\\nenjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tired to\\ndeath and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards\\n\\n\\nThe gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening\\nmeal at home in the living room that was used by everyone and so\\nthe door to this room was often kept closed in the evening  But\\nGregor found it easy to give up having the door open he had after\\nall often failed to make use of it when it was open and without\\nthe family having noticed it lain in his room in its darkest\\ncorner  One time though the charwoman left the door to the living\\nroom slightly open and it remained open when the gentlemen who\\nrented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on\\nThey sat up at the table where formerly Gregor had taken his meals\\nwith his father and mother they unfolded the serviettes and picked\\nup their knives and forks  Gregors mother immediately appeared in\\nthe doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sister\\nwith a dish piled high with potatoes  The food was steaming and\\nfilled the room with its smell  The gentlemen bent over the dishes\\nset in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before\\neating it and the gentleman in the middle who seemed to count as\\nan authority for the other two did indeed cut off a piece of meat\\nwhile it was still in its dish clearly wishing to establish whether\\nit was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the\\nkitchen  It was to his satisfaction and Gregors mother and\\nsister who had been looking on anxiously began to breathe again\\nand smiled\\n\\n\\nThe family themselves ate in the kitchen  Nonetheless Gregors\\nfather came into the living room before he went into the kitchen\\nbowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table\\nThe gentlemen stood as one and mumbled something into their beards\\n Then once they were alone they ate in near perfect silence  It\\nseemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises of\\neating their chewing teeth could still be heard as if they had\\nwanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was\\nnot possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless\\nhowever nice they might be  Id like to eat something said\\nGregor anxiously but not anything like theyre eating  They do\\nfeed themselves  And here I am dying\\n\\n\\nThroughout all this time Gregor could not remember having heard the\\nviolin being played but this evening it began to be heard from the\\nkitchen  The three gentlemen had already finished their meal the\\none in the middle had produced a newspaper given a page to each of\\nthe others and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and\\nsmoking  When the violin began playing they became attentive stood\\nup and went on tiptoe over to the door of the hallway where they\\nstood pressed against each other  Someone must have heard them in\\nthe kitchen as Gregors father called out Is the playing perhaps\\nunpleasant for the gentlemen We can stop it straight away  On\\nthe contrary said the middle gentleman would the young lady not\\nlike to come in and play for us here in the room where it is after\\nall much more cosy and comfortable  Oh yes wed love to\\ncalled back Gregors father as if he had been the violin player\\nhimself  The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited\\nGregors father soon appeared with the music stand his mother with\\nthe music and his sister with the violin  She calmly prepared\\neverything for her to begin playing his parents who had never\\nrented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated\\ncourtesy towards the three gentlemen did not even dare to sit on\\ntheir own chairs his father leant against the door with his right\\nhand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat his mother\\nthough was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat  leaving\\nthe chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it  out of\\nthe way in a corner\\n\\n\\nHis sister began to play father and mother paid close attention\\none on each side to the movements of her hands  Drawn in by the\\nplaying Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had\\nhis head in the living room  Before he had taken great pride in\\nhow considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had\\nbecome so thoughtless about the others  Whats more there was now\\nall the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the\\ndust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest\\nmovement he carried threads hairs and remains of food about on\\nhis back and sides he was much too indifferent to everything now to\\nlay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used to\\ndo several times a day  And despite this condition he was not too\\nshy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living\\nroom\\n\\n\\nNoone noticed him though  The family was totally preoccupied with\\nthe violin playing at first the three gentlemen had put their\\nhands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the music\\nstand to look at all the notes being played and they must have\\ndisturbed Gregors sister but soon in contrast with the family\\nthey  withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking\\nto each other at half volume and they stayed by the window while\\nGregors father observed them anxiously  It really now seemed very\\nobvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or\\nentertaining violin playing but had been disappointed that they had\\nhad enough of the whole performance and it was only now out of\\npoliteness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed  It was\\nespecially unnerving the way they all blew the smoke from their\\ncigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses  Yet Gregors sister\\nwas playing so beautifully  Her face was leant to one side\\nfollowing the lines of music with a careful and melancholy\\nexpression  Gregor crawled a little further forward keeping his\\nhead close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the\\nchance came  Was he an animal if music could captivate him so It\\nseemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown\\nnourishment he had been yearning for  He was determined to make his\\nway forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might\\ncome into his room with her violin as noone appreciated her\\nplaying here as much as he would  He never wanted to let her out of\\nhis room not while he lived anyway his shocking appearance\\nshould for once be of some use to him he wanted to be at every\\ndoor of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers his\\nsister should not be forced to stay with him though but stay of\\nher own free will she would sit beside him on the couch with her\\near bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to\\nsend her to the conservatory how he would have told everyone about\\nit last Christmas  had Christmas really come and gone already  if\\nthis misfortune hadnt got in the way and refuse to let anyone\\ndissuade him from it  On hearing all this his sister would break\\nout in tears of emotion and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder\\nand kiss her neck which since she had been going out to work she\\nhad kept free without any necklace or collar\\n\\n\\nMr Samsa shouted the middle gentleman to Gregors father\\npointing without wasting any more words with his forefinger at\\nGregor as he slowly moved forward  The violin went silent the\\nmiddle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends\\nshaking his head and then looked back at Gregor  His father seemed\\nto think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before\\ndriving Gregor out even though they were not at all upset and\\nseemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing\\nhad been  He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and\\nattempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as\\ntrying to block their view of Gregor with his body  Now they did\\nbecome a little annoyed and it was not clear whether it was his\\nfathers behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that\\nthey had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room without\\nknowing it  They asked Gregors father for explanations raised\\ntheir arms like he had tugged excitedly at their beards and moved\\nback towards their room only very slowly  Meanwhile Gregors sister\\nhad overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was\\nsuddenly interrupted  She had let her hands drop and let violin and\\nbow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if\\nstill playing but then she suddenly pulled herself together lay\\nthe instrument on her mothers lap who still sat laboriously\\nstruggling for breath where she was and ran into the next room\\nwhich under pressure from her father the three gentlemen were more\\nquickly moving toward  Under his sisters experienced hand the\\npillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and\\nshe had already finished making the beds and slipped out again\\nbefore the three gentlemen had reached the room  Gregors father\\nseemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the\\nrespect he owed to his tenants  He urged them and pressed them\\nuntil when he was already at the door of the room the middle of\\nthe three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and\\nthereby brought Gregors father to a halt  I declare here and\\nnow he said raising his hand and glancing at Gregors mother and\\nsister to gain their attention too that with regard to the\\nrepugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family\\n here he looked briefly but decisively at the floor  I give\\nimmediate notice on my room  For the days that I have been living\\nhere I will of course pay nothing at all on the contrary I will\\nconsider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages\\nfrom you and believe me it would be very easy to set out the\\ngrounds for such an action  He was silent and looked straight\\nahead as if waiting for something  And indeed his two friends\\njoined in with the words And we also give immediate notice  With\\nthat he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door\\n\\n\\nGregors father staggered back to his seat feeling his way with his\\nhands and fell into it it looked as if he was stretching himself\\nout for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head\\nkept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all\\nThroughout all this Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen\\nhad first seen him  His disappointment at the failure of his plan\\nand perhaps also because he was weak from hunger made it impossible\\nfor him to move  He was sure that everyone would turn on him any\\nmoment and he waited  He was not even startled out of this state\\nwhen the violin on his mothers lap fell from her trembling fingers\\nand landed loudly on the floor\\n\\n\\nFather Mother said his sister hitting the table with her hand\\nas introduction we cant carry on like this  Maybe you cant see\\nit but I can  I dont want to call this monster my brother all I\\ncan say is we have to try and get rid of it  Weve done all thats\\nhumanly possible to look after it and be patient I dont think\\nanyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong\\n\\n\\nShes absolutely right said Gregors father to himself  His\\nmother who still had not had time to catch her breath began to\\ncough dully her hand held out in front of her and a deranged\\nexpression in her eyes\\n\\n\\nGregors sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her\\nforehead  Her words seemed to give Gregors father some more\\ndefinite ideas  He sat upright played with his uniform cap between\\nthe plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal and\\noccasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile\\n\\n\\nWe have to try and get rid of it said Gregors sister now\\nspeaking only to her father as her mother was too occupied with\\ncoughing to listen itll be the death of both of you I can see it\\ncoming  We cant all work as hard as we have to and then come home\\nto be tortured like this we cant endure it  I cant endure it any\\nmore  And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down\\nthe face of her mother and she wiped them away with mechanical hand\\nmovements\\n\\n\\nMy child said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding\\nwhat are we to do\\n\\n\\nHis sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness\\nand tears that had taken hold of her displacing her earlier\\ncertainty\\n\\n\\nIf he could just understand us said his father almost as a\\nquestion his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as\\na sign that of that there was no question\\n\\n\\nIf he could just understand us repeated Gregors father closing\\nhis eyes in acceptance of his sisters certainty that that was quite\\nimpossible then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement\\nwith him  But as it is \\n\\n\\nIts got to go shouted his sister thats the only way Father\\nYouve got to get rid of the idea that thats Gregor  Weve only\\nharmed ourselves by believing it for so long  How can that be\\nGregor If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that its not\\npossible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he\\nwould have gone of his own free will  We wouldnt have a brother\\nany more then but we could carry on with our lives and remember\\nhim with respect  As it is this animal is persecuting us its\\ndriven out our tenants it obviously wants to take over the whole\\nflat and force us to sleep on the streets  Father look just\\nlook she suddenly screamed hes starting again   In her alarm\\nwhich was totally beyond Gregors comprehension his sister even\\nabandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her\\nchair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay\\nanywhere near Gregor  She rushed over to behind her father who had\\nbecome excited merely because she was and stood up half raising his\\nhands in front of Gregors sister as if to protect her\\n\\n\\nBut Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone least of all\\nhis sister  All he had done was begin to turn round so that he\\ncould go back into his room although that was in itself quite\\nstartling as his painwracked condition meant that turning round\\nrequired a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help\\nhimself do it repeatedly raising it and striking it against the\\nfloor  He stopped and looked round  They seemed to have realised\\nhis good intention and had only been alarmed briefly  Now they all\\nlooked at him in unhappy silence  His mother lay in her chair with\\nher legs stretched out and pressed against each other her eyes\\nnearly closed with exhaustion his sister sat next to his father\\nwith her arms around his neck\\n\\n\\nMaybe now theyll let me turn round thought Gregor and went back\\nto work  He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had\\nsometimes to stop and take a rest  Noone was making him rush any\\nmore everything was left up to him  As soon as he had finally\\nfinished turning round he began to move straight ahead  He was\\namazed at the great distance that separated him from his room and\\ncould not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak\\nstate a little while before and almost without noticing it  He\\nconcentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that\\nthere was not a word not any cry from his family to distract him\\nHe did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway  He did\\nnot turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff\\nbut it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him had\\nchanged only his sister had stood up  With his last glance he saw\\nthat his mother had now fallen completely asleep\\n\\n\\nHe was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut\\nbolted and locked  The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him\\nthat his little legs collapsed under him  It was his sister who had\\nbeen in so much of a rush  She had been standing there waiting and\\nsprung forward lightly Gregor had not heard her coming at all and\\nas she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents At\\nlast\\n\\n\\nWhat now then Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the\\ndarkness  He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move\\nat all  This was no surprise to him it seemed rather that being\\nable to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then\\nwas unnatural  He also felt relatively comfortable  It is true\\nthat his entire body was aching but the pain seemed to be slowly\\ngetting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether\\nHe could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the\\ninflamed area around it which was entirely covered in white dust\\nHe thought back of his family with emotion and love  If it was\\npossible he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his\\nsister  He remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination\\nuntil he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning  He\\nwatched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the\\nwindow too  Then without his willing it his head sank down\\ncompletely and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils\\n\\n\\nWhen the cleaner came in early in the morning  theyd often asked\\nher not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her\\nhurry she still did so that everyone in the flat knew when shed\\narrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace  she\\nmade her usual brief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing\\nspecial  She thought he was laying there so still on purpose\\nplaying the martyr she attributed all possible understanding to\\nhim  She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand so she\\ntried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway  When she had no\\nsuccess with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked\\nat him a little and only when she found she could shove him across\\nthe floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention\\nShe soon realised what had really happened opened her eyes wide\\nwhistled to herself but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom\\ndoors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms Come and\\nave a look at this its dead just lying there stone dead\\n\\n\\nMr and  Mrs Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had\\nto make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before\\nthey could grasp what she was saying  But then each from his own\\nside they hurried out of bed  Mr Samsa threw the blanket over his\\nshoulders  Mrs Samsa just came out in her nightdress and that is\\nhow they went into Gregors room  On the way they opened the door\\nto the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the three\\ngentlemen had moved in she was fully dressed as if she had never\\nbeen asleep and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this\\nDead asked  Mrs Samsa looking at the charwoman enquiringly\\neven though she could have checked for herself and could have known\\nit even without checking  Thats what I said  replied the\\ncleaner and to prove it she gave Gregors body another shove with\\nthe broom sending it sideways across the floor  Mrs Samsa made a\\nmovement as if she wanted to hold back the broom but did not\\ncomplete it  Now then said  Mr Samsa lets give thanks to God\\nfor that He crossed himself and the three women followed his\\nexample  Grete who had not taken her eyes from the corpse said\\nJust look how thin he was  He didnt eat anything for so long\\nThe food came out again just the same as when it went in Gregors\\nbody was indeed completely dried up and flat they had not seen it\\nuntil then but now he was not lifted up on his little legs nor did\\nhe do anything to make them look away\\n\\n\\nGrete come with us in here for a little while said  Mrs Samsa\\nwith a pained smile and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom\\nbut not without looking back at the body  The cleaner shut the door\\nand opened the window wide  Although it was still early in the\\nmorning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it  It\\nwas already the end of March after all\\n\\n\\nThe three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in\\namazement for their breakfasts  they had been forgotten about\\nWhere is our breakfast the middle gentleman asked the cleaner\\nirritably  She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and\\nsilent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregors\\nroom  They did so and stood around Gregors corpse with their\\nhands in the pockets of their wellworn coats It was now quite\\nlight in the room\\n\\n\\nThen the door of the bedroom opened and  Mr Samsa appeared in his\\nuniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other  All\\nof them had been crying a little Grete now and then pressed her\\nface against her fathers arm\\n\\n\\nLeave my home  Now said  Mr Samsa indicating the door and\\nwithout letting the women from him  What do you mean asked the\\nmiddle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted and he smiled\\nsweetly  The other two held their hands behind their backs and\\ncontinually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud\\nquarrel which could only end in their favour  I mean just what I\\nsaid answered  Mr Samsa and with his two companions went in a\\nstraight line towards the man  At first he stood there still\\nlooking at the ground as if the contents of his head were\\nrearranging themselves into new positions  Alright well go\\nthen he said and looked up at  Mr Samsa as if he had been\\nsuddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from\\nMr Samsa for his decision  Mr Samsa merely opened his eyes wide\\nand briefly nodded to him several times  At that and without\\ndelay the man actually did take long strides into the front\\nhallway his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time\\nbefore and had been listening to what was being said  Now they\\njumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that\\nMr Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the\\nconnection with their leader  Once there all three took their hats\\nfrom the stand took their sticks from the holder bowed without a\\nword and left the premises  Mr Samsa and the two women followed\\nthem out onto the landing but they had had no reason to mistrust\\nthe mens intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how\\nthe three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many\\nsteps  As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and\\nwould reappear a few moments later the further down they went the\\nmore that the Samsa family lost interest in them when a butchers\\nboy proud of posture with his tray on his head passed them on his\\nway up and came nearer than they were  Mr Samsa and the women came\\naway from the landing and went as if relieved back into the flat\\n\\n\\nThey decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation\\nand to go for a walk not only had they earned a break from work but\\nthey were in serious need of it  So they sat at the table and wrote\\nthree letters of excusal  Mr Samsa to his employers  Mrs Samsa\\nto her contractor and Grete to her principal  The cleaner came in\\nwhile they were writing to tell them she was going shed finished\\nher work for that morning  The three of them at first just nodded\\nwithout looking up from what they were writing and it was only when\\nthe cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up\\nin irritation  Well asked  Mr Samsa  The charwoman stood in\\nthe doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous\\ngood news to report but would only do it if she was clearly asked\\nto  The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat which\\nhad been a source of irritation to  Mr Samsa all the time she had\\nbeen working for them swayed gently in all directions  What is it\\nyou want then asked  Mrs Samsa whom the cleaner had the most\\nrespect for  Yes she answered and broke into a friendly laugh\\nthat made her unable to speak straight away well then that thing\\nin there you neednt worry about how youre going to get rid of it\\n Thats all been sorted out   Mrs Samsa and Grete bent down over\\ntheir letters as if intent on continuing with what they were\\nwriting  Mr Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing\\neverything in detail but with outstretched hand he made it quite\\nclear that she was not to  So as she was prevented from telling\\nthem all about it she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in\\nand clearly peeved called out Cheerio then everyone turned\\nround sharply and left slamming the door terribly as she went\\n\\n\\nTonight she gets sacked said  Mr Samsa but he received no reply\\nfrom either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have\\ndestroyed the peace they had only just gained  They got up and went\\nover to the window where they remained with their arms around each\\nother  Mr Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat\\nthere watching for a while  Then he called out Come here then\\nLets forget about all that old stuff shall we  Come and give me a\\nbit of attention The two women immediately did as he said\\nhurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then\\nthey quickly finished their letters\\n\\n\\nAfter that the three of them left the flat together which was\\nsomething they had not done for months and took the tram out to the\\nopen country outside the town  They had the tram filled with warm\\nsunshine all to themselves  Leant back comfortably on their seats\\nthey discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination\\nthey were not at all bad  until then they had never asked each\\nother about their work but all three had jobs which were very good\\nand held particularly good promise for the future  The greatest\\nimprovement for the time being of course would be achieved quite\\neasily by moving house what they needed now was a flat that was\\nsmaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by\\nGregor one that was in a better location and most of all more\\npractical  All the time Grete was becoming livelier  With all the\\nworry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale but\\nwhile they were talking  Mr and  Mrs Samsa were struck almost\\nsimultaneously with the thought of how their daughter was\\nblossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady  They became\\nquieter  Just from each others glance and almost without knowing\\nit they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for\\nher  And as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good\\nintentions as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the\\nfirst to get up and stretch out her young body\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka\\nTranslated by David Wyllie\\n\\n\\n END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG

              "'\\ufeffOne morning when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin  He lay on his armourlike back and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections  The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment  His many legs pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him waved about helplessly as he looked   Whats happened to me he thought  It wasnt a dream  His room a proper human room although a little too small lay peacefully between its four familiar walls  A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table  Samsa was a travelling salesman  and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice gilded frame  It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer   Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane which made him feel quite sad  How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense he thought but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right and in his present state couldnt get into that position  However hard he threw himself onto his right he always rolled back to where he was  He must have tried it a hundred times shut his eyes so that he wouldnt have to look at the floundering legs and only stopped when he began to feel a mild dull pain there that he had never felt before   Oh God he thought what a strenuous career it is that Ive chosen Travelling day in and day out  Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home and on top of that theres the curse of travelling worries about making train connections bad and irregular food contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them  It can all go to Hell  He felt a slight itch up on his belly pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better found where the itch was and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didnt know what to make of and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder   He slid back into his former position  Getting up early all the time he thought it makes you stupid  Youve got to get enough sleep  Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury  For instance whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts  I ought to just try that with my boss Id get kicked out on the spot  But who knows maybe that would be the best thing for me  If I didnt have my parents to think about Id have given in my notice a long time ago Id have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think tell him everything I would let him know just what I feel  Hed fall right off his desk And its a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk talking down at your subordinates from up there especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing  Well theres still some hope once Ive got the money together to pay off my parents debt to him  another five or six years I suppose  thats definitely what Ill do  Thats when Ill make the big change  First of all though Ive got to get up my train leaves at five   And he looked over at the alarm clock ticking on the chest of drawers  God in Heaven he thought  It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards it was even later than half past more like quarter to seven  Had the alarm clock not rung He could see from the bed that it had been set for four oclock as it should have been it certainly must have rung  Yes but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniturerattling noise True he had not slept peacefully but probably all the more deeply because of that  What should he do now The next train went at seven if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively  And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his bosss anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five oclock train go he would have put in his report about Gregors not being there a long time ago  The office assistant was the bosss man spineless and with no understanding  What about if he reported sick But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill  His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company accuse his parents of having a lazy son and accept the doctors recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that noone was ever ill but that many were workshy  And whats more would he have been entirely wrong in this case Gregor did in fact apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual   He was still hurriedly thinking all this through unable to decide to get out of the bed when the clock struck quarter to seven There was a cautious knock at the door near his head  Gregor somebody called  it was his mother  its quarter to seven Didnt you want to go somewhere  That gentle voice Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had before  As if from deep inside him there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear leaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not  Gregor had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything but in the circumstances contented himself with saying Yes mother yes thankyou Im getting up now  The change in Gregors voice probably could not be noticed outside through the wooden door as his mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away  But this short conversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor against their expectations was still at home and soon his father came knocking at one of the side doors gently but with his fist Gregor Gregor he called whats wrong  And after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice Gregor Gregor  At the other side door his sister came plaintively Gregor Arent you well Do you need anything  Gregor answered to both sides Im ready now making an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each individual word  His father went back to his breakfast but his sister whispered Gregor open the door I beg of you  Gregor however had no thought of opening the door and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit acquired from his travelling of locking all doors at night even when he was at home   The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed to get dressed and most of all to have his breakfast Only then would he consider what to do next as he was well aware that he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed  He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed perhaps caused by lying awkwardly but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve themselves today  He did not have the slightest doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen   It was a simple matter to throw off the covers he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves  But it became difficult after that especially as he was so exceptionally broad He would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions and which he was moreover unable to control  If he wanted to bend one of them then that was the first one that would stretch itself out and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully  This is something that cant be done in bed Gregor said to himself so dont keep trying to do it   The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the bed but he had never seen this lower part and could not imagine what it looked like it turned out to be too hard to move it went so slowly and finally almost in a frenzy when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather he chose the wrong direction hit hard against the lower bedpost and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might well at present be the most sensitive   So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first carefully turning his head to the side  This he managed quite easily and despite its breadth and its weight the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head But when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the same way  And he could not knock himself out now at any price better to stay in bed than lose consciousness   It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier but when he lay there sighing and was once more watching his legs as they struggled against each other even harder than before if that was possible he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos  He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice  At the same time though he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions  At times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could but unfortunately even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him  Seven oclock already he said to himself when the clock struck again seven oclock and theres still a fog like this  And he lay there quietly a while longer breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and natural state   But then he said to himself Before it strikes quarter past seven Ill definitely have to have got properly out of bed  And by then somebody will have come round from work to ask whats happened to me as well as they open up at work before seven oclock  And so he set himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all at the same time  If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it  His back seemed to be quite hard and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet  His main concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make and which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm  But it was something that had to be risked   When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed  the new method was more of a game than an effort all he had to do was rock back and forth  it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody came to help him  Two strong people  he had his father and the maid in mind  would have been more than enough they would only have to push their arms under the dome of his back peel him away from the bed bend down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor where hopefully the little legs would find a use  Should he really call for help though even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked Despite all the difficulty he was in he could not suppress a smile at this thought   After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard  The time was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very soon  Then there was a ring at the door of the flat Thatll be someone from work he said to himself and froze very still although his little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around  For a moment everything remained quiet Theyre not opening the door Gregor said to himself caught in some nonsensical hope  But then of course the maids firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it  Gregor only needed to hear the visitors first words of greeting and he knew who it was  the chief clerk himself  Why did Gregor have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming Were all employees every one of them louts was there not one of them who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he couldnt get out of bed if he didnt spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business Was it really not enough to let one of the trainees make enquiries  assuming enquiries were even necessary  did the chief clerk have to come himself and did they have to show the whole innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision he swang himself with all his force out of the bed  There was a loud thump but it wasnt really a loud noise  His fall was softened a little by the carpet and Gregors back was also more elastic than he had thought which made the sound muffled and not too noticeable  He had not held his head carefully enough though and hit it as he fell annoyed and in pain he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet   Somethings fallen down in there said the chief clerk in the room on the left  Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too you had to concede that it was possible  But as if in gruff reply to this question the chief clerks firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room From the room on his right Gregors sister whispered to him to let him know Gregor the chief clerk is here  Yes I know said Gregor to himself but without daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him   Gregor said his father now from the room to his left the chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didnt leave on the early train  We dont know what to say to him  And anyway he wants to speak to you personally  So please open up this door  Im sure hell be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room Then the chief clerk called Good morning  Mr Samsa He isnt well said his mother to the chief clerk while his father continued to speak through the door  He isnt well please believe me  Why else would Gregor have missed a train The lad only ever thinks about the business  It nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings hes been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening  He sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables  His idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw  Hes made a little frame for instance it only took him two or three evenings youll be amazed how nice it is its hanging up in his room youll see it as soon as Gregor opens the door  Anyway Im glad youre here we wouldnt have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves hes so stubborn and Im sure he isnt well he said this morning that he is but he isnt  Ill be there in a moment said Gregor slowly and thoughtfully but without moving so that he would not miss any word of the conversation  Well I cant think of any other way of explaining it  Mrs Samsa said the chief clerk I hope its nothing serious  But on the other hand I must say that if we people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then fortunately or unfortunately as you like we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations  Can the chief clerk come in to see you now then asked his father impatiently knocking at the door again  No said Gregor  In the room on his right there followed a painful silence in the room on his left his sister began to cry   So why did his sister not go and join the others She had probably only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed  And why was she crying Was it because he had not got up and had not let the chief clerk in because he was in danger of losing his job and if that happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same demands as before There was no need to worry about things like that yet  Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family  For the time being he just lay there on the carpet and noone who knew the condition he was in would seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in  It was only a minor discourtesy and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later on it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot  And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying  But the others didnt know what was happening they were worried that would excuse their behaviour   The chief clerk now raised his voice Mr Samsa he called to him what is wrong You barricade yourself in your room give us no more than yes or no for an answer you are causing serious and unnecessary concern to your parents and you fail  and I mention this just by the way  you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite unheard of  Im speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your employer and really must request a clear and immediate explanation  I am astonished quite astonished  I thought I knew you as a calm and sensible person and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims  This morning your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear its true  it had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to you  but I came near to giving him my word of honour that that could not be the right explanation  But now that I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on your behalf  And nor is your position all that secure  I had originally intended to say all this to you in private but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason I dont see why your parents should not also learn of it Your turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late I grant you that its not the time of year to do especially good business we recognise that but there simply is no time of year to do no business at all  Mr Samsa we cannot allow there to be   But Sir called Gregor beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement Ill open up immediately just a moment  Im slightly unwell an attack of dizziness I havent been able to get up  Im still in bed now  Im quite fresh again now though  Im just getting out of bed  Just a moment  Be patient Its not quite as easy as Id thought  Im quite alright now though  Its shocking what can suddenly happen to a person I was quite alright last night my parents know about it perhaps better than me I had a small symptom of it last night already  They must have noticed it  I dont know why I didnt let you know at work But you always think you can get over an illness without staying at home  Please dont make my parents suffer Theres no basis for any of the accusations youre making nobodys ever said a word to me about any of these things  Maybe you havent read the latest contracts I sent in  Ill set off with the eight oclock train as well these few hours of rest have given me strength  You dont need to wait sir Ill be in the office soon after you and please be so good as to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him   And while Gregor gushed out these words hardly knowing what he was saying he made his way over to the chest of drawers  this was easily done probably because of the practise he had already had in bed  where he now tried to get himself upright  He really did want to open the door really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk the others were being so insistent and he was curious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him If they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregors responsibility and he could rest  If however they took everything calmly he would still have no reason to be upset and if he hurried he really could be at the station for eight oclock  The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again but he finally gave himself one last swing and stood there upright the lower part of his body was in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it  Now he let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with his little legs  By now he had also calmed down and kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying   Did you understand a word of all that the chief clerk asked his parents surely hes not trying to make fools of us Oh God called his mother who was already in tears he could be seriously ill and were making him suffer  Grete Grete she then cried Mother his sister called from the other side  They communicated across Gregors room  Youll have to go for the doctor straight away  Gregor is ill  Quick get the doctor  Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just now  That was the voice of an animal said the chief clerk with a calmness that was in contrast with his mothers screams  Anna Anna his father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall clapping his hands get a locksmith here now And the two girls their skirts swishing immediately ran out through the hall wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went  How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly There was no sound of the door banging shut again they must have left it open  people often do in homes where something awful has happened   Gregor in contrast had become much calmer  So they couldnt understand his words any more although they seemed clear enough to him clearer than before  perhaps his ears had become used to the sound  They had realised though that there was something wrong with him and were ready to help  The first response to his situation had been confident and wise and that made him feel better  He felt that he had been drawn back in among people and from the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising achievements  although he did not really distinguish one from the other  Whatever was said next would be crucial so in order to make his voice as clear as possible he coughed a little but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure he could judge this for himself  Meanwhile it had become very quiet in the next room  Perhaps his parents were sat at the table whispering with the chief clerk or perhaps they were all pressed against the door and listening   Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair  Once there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs  He rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth  He seemed unfortunately to have no proper teeth  how was he then to grasp the key  but the lack of teeth was of course made up for with a very strong jaw using the jaw he really was able to start the key turning ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor Listen said the chief clerk in the next room hes turning the key  Gregor was greatly encouraged by this but they all should have been calling to him his father and his mother too Well done Gregor they should have cried keep at it keep hold of the lock  And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts he bit on the key with all his strength paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself  As the key turned round he turned around the lock with it only holding himself upright with his mouth and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the whole weight of his body as needed  The clear sound of the lock as it snapped back was Gregors sign that he could break his concentration and as he regained his breath he said to himself So I didnt need the locksmith after all Then he lay his head on the handle of the door to open it completely   Because he had to open the door in this way it was already wide open before he could be seen  He had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double doors and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the room  He was still occupied with this difficult movement unable to pay attention to anything else when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud Oh which sounded like the soughing of the wind Now he also saw him  he was the nearest to the door  his hand pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force  Gregors mother her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerks being there looked at his father  Then she unfolded her arms took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast  His father looked hostile and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room  Then he looked uncertainly round the living room covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook   So Gregor did not go into the room but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place  In this way only half of his body could be seen along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others Meanwhile the day had become much lighter part of the endless greyblack building on the other side of the street  which was a hospital  could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its facade the rain was still falling now throwing down large individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time  The washing up from breakfast lay on the table there was so much of it because for Gregors father breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of different newspapers  On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing  The door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below   Now then said Gregor well aware that he was the only one to have kept calm Ill get dressed straight away now pack up my samples and set off  Will you please just let me leave You can see he said to the chief clerk that Im not stubborn and I like to do my job being a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldnt earn my living  So where are you going in to the office Yes Will you report everything accurately then Its quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work but thats just the right time to remember whats been achieved in the past and consider that later on once the difficulty has been removed he will certainly work with all the more diligence and concentration  Youre well aware that Im seriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my parents and my sister so that Im trapped in a difficult situation but I will work my way out of it again  Please dont make things any harder for me than they are already and dont take sides against me at the office  I know that nobody likes the travellers  They think we earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it  Thats just prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it  But you sir you have a better overview than the rest of the staff in fact if I can say this in confidence a better overview than the boss himself  its very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should  And youre also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints and its almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing we dont usually even hear about them or if at all its when we arrive back home exhausted from a trip and thats when we feel the harmful effects of whats been going on without even knowing what caused them  Please dont go away at least first say something to show that you grant that Im at least partly right   But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to speak and with protruding lips only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders as he left  He did not keep still for a moment while Gregor was speaking but moved steadily towards the door without taking his eyes off him  He moved very gradually as if there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room  It was only when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement drew his foot from the living room and rushed forward in a panic  In the hall he stretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there there were some supernatural force waiting to save him   Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger  That was something his parents did not understand very well over the years they had become convinced that this job would provide for Gregor for his entire life and besides they had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for the future  Gregor though did think about the future  The chief clerk had to be held back calmed down convinced and finally won over the future of Gregor and his family depended on it If only his sister were here She was clever she was already in tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully on his back  And the chief clerk was a lover of women surely she could persuade him she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state  But his sister was not there Gregor would have to do the job himself  And without considering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move about in his present state or that his speech still might not  or probably would not  be understood he let go of the door pushed himself through the opening tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who ridiculously was holding on to the banister with both hands but Gregor fell immediately over and with a little scream as he sought something to hold onto landed on his numerous little legs  Hardly had that happened than for the first time that day he began to feel alright with his body the little legs had the solid ground under them to his pleasure they did exactly as he told them they were even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go and he was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end  He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there on the floor  His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed at first quite engrossed in herself but then she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting Help for pitys sake Help  The way she held her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not she had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the breakfast things on it when she reached the table she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet   Mother mother said Gregor gently looking up at her  He had completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment but could not help himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of coffee  That set his mother screaming anew she fled from the table and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her Gregor though had no time to spare for his parents now the chief clerk had already reached the stairs with his chin on the banister he looked back for the last time  Gregor made a run for him he wanted to be sure of reaching him the chief clerk must have expected something as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared his shouts resounding all around the staircase  The flight of the chief clerk seemed unfortunately to put Gregors father into a panic as well  Until then he had been relatively self controlled but now instead of running after the chief clerk himself or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him Gregors father seized the chief clerks stick in his right hand the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair along with his hat and overcoat picked up a large newspaper from the table with his left and used them to drive Gregor back into his room stamping his foot at him as he went  Gregors appeals to his father were of no help his appeals were simply not understood however much he humbly turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder Across the room despite the chilly weather Gregors mother had pulled open a window leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face  A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway the curtains flew up the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor  Nothing would stop Gregors father as he drove him back making hissing noises at him like a wild man  Gregor had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go very slowly  If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room straight away but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that his father would become impatient and there was the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his fathers hand any moment  Eventually though Gregor realised that he had no choice as he saw to his disgust that he was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight line so he began as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at his father to turn himself round  It went very slowly but perhaps his father was able to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him in fact now and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a distance as to which way to turn  If only his father would stop that unbearable hissing It was making Gregor quite confused  When he had nearly finished turning round still listening to that hissing he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come  He was pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway but then saw that it was too narrow and his body was too broad to get through it without further difficulty  In his present mood it obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through  He was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible  Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway  What he did making more noise than ever was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way it sounded to Gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him it was not a pleasant experience and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen  One side of his body lifted itself he lay at an angle in the doorway one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured leaving vile brown flecks on it soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground  Then his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from where he was held and sent him flying and heavily bleeding deep into his room  The door was slammed shut with the stick then finally all was quiet       II     It was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke from his deep and comalike sleep  He would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if he hadnt been disturbed as he had had enough sleep and felt fully rested  But he had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him  The light from the electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture but down below where Gregor was it was dark  He pushed himself over to the door feeling his way clumsily with his antennae  of which he was now beginning to learn the value  in order to see what had been happening there  The whole of his left side seemed like one painfully stretched scar  and he limped badly on his two rows of legs  One of the legs had been badly injured in the events of that morning  it was nearly a miracle that only one of them had been  and dragged along lifelessly   It was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it actually was that had drawn him over to it it was the smell of something to eat  By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it  He was so pleased he almost laughed as he was even hungrier than he had been that morning and immediately dipped his head into the milk nearly covering his eyes with it  But he soon drew his head back again in disappointment not only did the pain in his tender left side make it difficult to eat the food  he was only able to eat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole  but the milk did not taste at all nice  Milk like this was normally his favourite drink and his sister had certainly left it there for him because of that but he turned almost against his own will away from the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room   Through the crack in the door Gregor could see that the gas had been lit in the living room  His father at this time would normally be sat with his evening paper reading it out in a loud voice to Gregors mother and sometimes to his sister but there was now not a sound to be heard  Gregors sister would often write and tell him about this reading but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times  It was so quiet all around too even though there must have been somebody in the flat  What a quiet life it is the family lead said Gregor to himself and gazing into the darkness felt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and parents  But what now if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and frightening end That was something that Gregor did not want to think about too much so he started to move about crawling up and down the room   Once during that long evening the door on one side of the room was opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again later on the door on the other side did the same it seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better of it  Gregor went and waited immediately by the door resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it was but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited in vain  The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him but now now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time during the day noone came and the keys were in the other sides   It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had stayed awake all that time as they all could be distinctly heard as they went away together on tiptoe  It was clear that noone would come into Gregors room any more until morning that gave him plenty of time to think undisturbed about how he would have to rearrange his life  For some reason the tall empty room where he was forced to remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor even though he had been living in it for five years  Hardly aware of what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame he hurried under the couch  It pressed down on his back a little and he was no longer able to lift his head but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath   He spent the whole night there  Some of the time he passed in a light sleep although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his hunger and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which however always led to the same conclusion for the time being he must remain calm he must show patience and the greatest consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he in his present condition was forced to impose on them   Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions as early the next morning almost before the night had ended his sister nearly fully dressed opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in  She did not see him straight away but when she did notice him under the couch  he had to be somewhere for Gods sake he couldnt have flown away  she was so shocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut again from outside  But she seemed to regret her behaviour as she opened the door again straight away and came in on tiptoe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger Gregor had pushed his head forward right to the edge of the couch and watched her  Would she notice that he had left the milk as it was realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring him in some other food that was more suitable If she didnt do it herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the couch throw himself at his sisters feet and beg her for something good to eat  However his sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise  She immediately picked it up  using a rag not her bare hands  and carried it out  Gregor was extremely curious as to what she would bring in its place imagining the wildest possibilities but he never could have guessed what his sister in her goodness actually did bring  In order to test his taste she brought him a whole selection of things all spread out on an old newspaper  There were old halfrotten vegetables bones from the evening meal covered in white sauce that had gone hard a few raisins and almonds some cheese that Gregor had declared inedible two days before a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt  As well as all that she had poured some water into the dish which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregors use and placed it beside them  Then out of consideration for Gregors feelings as she knew that he would not eat in front of her she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he liked  Gregors little legs whirred at last he could eat  Whats more his injuries must already have completely healed as he found no difficulty in moving  This amazed him as more than a month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife he thought of how his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday Am I less sensitive than I used to be then he thought and was already sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately almost compellingly attracted him much more than the other foods on the newspaper  Quickly one after another his eyes watering with pleasure he consumed the cheese the vegetables and the sauce the fresh foods on the other hand he didnt like at all and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them because he couldnt stand the smell  Long after he had finished eating and lay lethargic in the same place his sister slowly turned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw  He was immediately startled although he had been half asleep and he hurried back under the couch  But he needed great selfcontrol to stay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room as eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could hardly breathe in that narrow space  Half suffocating he watched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the leftovers mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more She quickly dropped it all into a bin closed it with its wooden lid and carried everything out  She had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretched himself   This was how Gregor received his food each day now once in the morning while his parents and the maid were still asleep and the second time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would sleep for a little while then as well and Gregors sister would send the maid away on some errand  Gregors father and mother certainly did not want him to starve either but perhaps it would have been more than they could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being told about it and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were indeed suffering enough   It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat  As nobody could understand him nobody not even his sister thought that he could understand them so he had to be content to hear his sisters sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room  It was only later when she had become a little more used to everything  there was of course no question of her ever becoming fully used to the situation  that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment or at least a comment that could be construed as friendly  Hes enjoyed his dinner today she might say when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him or if he left most of it which slowly became more and more frequent she would often say sadly now everythings just been left there again   Although Gregor wasnt able to hear any news directly he did listen to much of what was said in the next rooms and whenever he heard anyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his whole body against it  There was seldom any conversation especially at first that was not about him in some way even if only in secret  For two whole days all the talk at every mealtime was about what they should do now but even between meals they spoke about the same subject as there were always at least two members of the family at home  nobody wanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty  And on the very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged Gregors mother to let her go without delay  It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour tearfully thanking Gregors mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service  She even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had happened even though noone had asked that of her   Now Gregors sister also had to help his mother with the cooking although that was not so much bother as noone ate very much Gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat and receive no more answer than no thanks Ive had enough or something similar  Noone drank very much either  His sister would sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer hoping for the chance to go and fetch it herself  When his father then said nothing she would add so that he would not feel selfish that she could send the housekeeper for it but then his father would close the matter with a big loud No and no more would be said   Even before the first day had come to an end his father had explained to Gregors mother and sister what their finances and prospects were  Now and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved from his business when it had collapsed five years earlier  Gregor heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he wanted  What he heard his father say was some of the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room  He had thought that nothing at all remained from his fathers business at least he had never told him anything different and Gregor had never asked him about it anyway Their business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total despair and Gregors only concern at that time had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it as quickly as possible  So then he started working especially hard with a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling representative almost overnight bringing with it the chance to earn money in quite different ways  Gregor converted his success at work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the benefit of his astonished and delighted family  They had been good times and they had never come again at least not with the same splendour even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family and did bear them  They had even got used to it both Gregor and the family they took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it although there was no longer much warm affection given in return Gregor only remained close to his sister now  Unlike him she was very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist it was his secret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some other way  During Gregors short periods in town conversation with his sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised  Their parents did not like to hear this innocent talk but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he would let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day   That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind in his present state pressed upright against the door and listening  There were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it up again with a start as even the slightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would all go silent  Whats that hes doing now his father would say after a while clearly having gone over to the door and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again   When explaining things his father repeated himself several times partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these matters himself and partly because Gregors mother did not understand everything the first time  From these repeated explanations Gregor learned to his pleasure that despite all their misfortunes there was still some money available from the old days  It was not a lot but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated  Besides that they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had been bringing home every month keeping only a little for himself so that that too had been accumulating Behind the door Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution  He could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his fathers debt to his boss and the day when he could have freed himself from that job would have come much closer but now it was certainly better the way his father had done things   This money however was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest it was enough to maintain them for perhaps one or two years no more  Thats to say it was money that should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies money to live on had to be earned  His father was healthy but old and lacking in self confidence  During the five years that he had not been working  the first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success  he had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy  Would Gregors elderly mother now have to go and earn money She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window  Would his sister have to go and earn money She was still a child of seventeen her life up till then had been very enviable consisting of wearing nice clothes sleeping late helping out in the business joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin  Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself onto the cool leather sofa next to it as he became quite hot with shame and regret   He would often lie there the whole night through not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end  Or he might go to all the effort of pushing a chair to the window climbing up onto the sill and propped up in the chair leaning on the window to stare out of it  He had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this but doing it now was obviously something more remembered than experienced  as what he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day even things that were quite near he had used to curse the everpresent view of the hospital across the street but now he could not see it at all and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city he could have thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably  His observant sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on   If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it but as it was it caused him pain  His sister naturally tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it and the longer it went on of course the better she was able to do so but as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much better  It had even become very unpleasant for him now whenever she entered the room  No sooner had she come in than she would quickly close the door as a precaution so that noone would have to suffer the view into Gregors room then she would go straight to the window and pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating  Even if it was cold she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while  She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and noise making he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this ordeal but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him with the windows closed   One day about a month after Gregors transformation when his sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance she came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still staring out the window motionless and just where he would be most horrible  In itself his sisters not coming into the room would have been no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to immediately open the window while he was still there but not only did she not come in she went straight back and closed the door behind her a stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite her  Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch of course but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than usual  It made him realise that she still found his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so she probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that protruded from under the couch  One day in order to spare her even this sight he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do was take it off again as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely  She left the sheet where it was  Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how his sister liked the new arrangement   For the first fourteen days Gregors parents could not bring themselves to come into the room to see him  He would often hear them say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even though before they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with her  But now the two of them father and mother would often both wait outside the door of Gregors room while his sister tidied up in there and as soon as she went out again she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked what Gregor had eaten how he had behaved this time and whether perhaps any slight improvement could be seen His mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first persuaded her against it  Gregor listened very closely to all this and approved fully  Later though she had to be held back by force which made her call out Let me go and see Gregor he is my unfortunate son Cant you understand I have to see him and Gregor would think to himself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in not every day of course but one day a week perhaps she could understand everything much better than his sister who for all her courage was still just a child after all and really might not have had an adults appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on   Gregors wish to see his mother was soon realised  Out of consideration for his parents Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room to crawl about it was hard to just lie quietly through the night his food soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all and so to entertain himself he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling  He was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling it was quite different from lying on the floor he could breathe more freely his body had a light swing to it and up there relaxed and almost happy it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash  But now of course he had far better control of his body than before and even with a fall as great as that caused himself no damage  Very soon his sister noticed Gregors new way of entertaining himself  he had after all left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about  and got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing the furniture that got in his way especially the chest of drawers and the desk  Now this was not something that she would be able to do by herself she did not dare to ask for help from her father the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this she had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to open the door unless it was especially important so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when Gregors father was not there and fetch his mother to help her  As she approached the room Gregor could hear his mother express her joy but once at the door she went silent  First of course his sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room was alright and only then did she let her mother enter  Gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance  Gregor also refrained this time from spying out from under the sheet he gave up the chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come  You can come in he cant be seen said his sister obviously leading her in by the hand  The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about but Gregor listened as they pushed it from its place his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the work for herself and ignoring her mothers warnings that she would strain herself  This lasted a very long time  After labouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the chest where it was for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the job finished before Gregors father got home and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way even more and for another thing it wasnt even sure that taking the furniture away would really be any help to him  She thought just the opposite the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her heart and why wouldnt Gregor feel the same way about it hed been used to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that  Then quietly almost whispering as if wanting Gregor whose whereabouts she did not know to hear not even the tone of her voice as she was convinced that he did not understand her words she added and by taking the furniture away wont it seem like were showing that weve given up all hope of improvement and were abandoning him to cope for himself I think itd be best to leave the room exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again hell find everything unchanged and hell be able to forget the time in between all the easier   Hearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the lack of any direct human communication along with the monotonous life led by the family during these two months must have made him confused  he could think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had seriously wanted his room emptied out  Had he really wanted to transform his room into a cave a warm room fitted out with the nice furniture he had inherited That would have let him crawl around unimpeded in any direction but it would also have let him quickly forget his past when he had still been human  He had come very close to forgetting and it had only been the voice of his mother unheard for so long that had shaken him out of it  Nothing should be removed everything had to stay he could not do without the good influence the furniture had on his condition and if the furniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage   His sister unfortunately did not agree she had become used to the idea not without reason that she was Gregors spokesman to his parents about the things that concerned him  This meant that his mothers advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk as she had thought at first but all the furniture apart from the allimportant couch  It was more than childish perversity of course or the unexpected confidence she had recently acquired that made her insist she had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in whereas the furniture as far as anyone could see was of no use to him at all  Girls of that age though do become enthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way whenever they can  Perhaps this was what tempted Grete to make Gregors situation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could do even more for him  Grete would probably be the only one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling about the bare walls by himself   So she refused to let her mother dissuade her  Gregors mother already looked uneasy in his room she soon stopped speaking and helped Gregors sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she had  The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if he had to but the writing desk had to stay Hardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers groaning out of the room than Gregor poked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about it  He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could but unfortunately it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the next room had her arms round the chest pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself without of course moving it an inch  His mother was not used to the sight of Gregor he might have made her ill so Gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch  In his startlement though he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a little  It was enough to attract his mothers attention  She stood very still remained there a moment and then went back out to Grete   Gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was happening it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro their little calls to each other the scraping of the furniture on the floor all these things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides  With his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to the floor he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand all of this much longer  They were emptying his room out taking away everything that was dear to him they had already taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools now they threatened to remove the writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor the desk where he had done his homework as a business trainee at high school even while he had been at infant schoolhe really could not wait any longer to see whether the two womens intentions were good  He had nearly forgotten they were there anyway as they were now too tired to say anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped heavily on the floor   So while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catching their breath he sallied out changed direction four times not knowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly caught by the picture on the wall  which was already denuded of everything else that had been on it  of the lady dressed in copious fur  He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass it held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly  This picture at least now totally covered by Gregor would certainly be taken away by noone  He turned his head to face the door into the living room so that he could watch the women when they came back   They had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her  What shall we take now then said Grete and looked around  Her eyes met those of Gregor on the wall  Perhaps only because her mother was there she remained calm bent her face to her so that she would not look round and said albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice Come on lets go back in the living room for a while  Gregor could see what Grete had in mind she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down from the wall  Well she could certainly try it He sat unyielding on his picture  He would rather jump at Gretes face   But Gretes words had made her mother quite worried she stepped to one side saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw screamed Oh God oh God  Arms outstretched she fell onto the couch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile Gregor shouted his sister glowering at him and shaking her fist  That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation  She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint Gregor wanted to help too  he could save his picture later although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force then he too ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in the old days but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing she was looking into various bottles he startled her when she turned round a bottle fell to the ground and broke a splinter cut Gregors face some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him now without delaying any longer Grete took hold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother she slammed the door shut with her foot  So now Gregor was shut out from his mother who because of him might be near to death he could not open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away and she had to stay with his mother there was nothing for him to do but wait and oppressed with anxiety and selfreproach he began to crawl about he crawled over everything walls furniture ceiling and finally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down into the middle of the dinner table   He lay there for a while numb and immobile all around him it was quiet maybe that was a good sign  Then there was someone at the door  The maid of course had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete would have to go and answer it  His father had arrived home  Whats happened were his first words Gretes appearance must have made everything clear to him  She answered him with subdued voice and openly pressed her face into his chest Mothers fainted but shes better now  Gregor got out  Just as I expected said his father just as I always said but you women wouldnt listen would you  It was clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father took it to mean that something bad had happened that he was responsible for some act of violence That meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father as he did not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been possible  So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself against it so that his father when he came in from the hall could see straight away that Gregor had the best intentions and would go back into his room without delay that it would not be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the door and he would disappear   His father though was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that Ah he shouted as he came in sounding as if he were both angry and glad at the same time  Gregor drew his head back from the door and lifted it towards his father  He really had not imagined his father the way he stood there now of late with his new habit of crawling about he had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the flat the way he had done before  He really ought to have expected things to have changed but still still was that really his father The same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when Gregor came back from his business trips who would receive him sitting in the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings who was hardly even able to stand up but as a sign of his pleasure would just raise his arms and who on the couple of times a year when they went for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother would always labour his way forward a little more slowly than them who were already walking slowly for his sake who would place his stick down carefully and if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his companions around him  He was standing up straight enough now dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons the sort worn by the employees at the banking institute above the high stiff collar of the coat his strong doublechin emerged under the bushy eyebrows his piercing dark eyes looked out fresh and alert his normally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp  He took his cap with its gold monogram from probably some bank and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa put his hands in his trouser pockets pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat and with look of determination walked towards Gregor  He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high  Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots but wasted no time with that  he knew full well right from the first day of his new life that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely strict with him  And so he ran up to his father stopped when his father stopped scurried forwards again when he moved even slightly  In this way they went round the room several times without anything decisive happening without even giving the impression of a chase as everything went so slowly  Gregor remained all this time on the floor largely because he feared his father might see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling  Whatever he did Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up this running about for long as for each step his father took he had to carry out countless movements He became noticeably short of breath even in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable  Now as he lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for running he could hardly keep his eyes open his thoughts became too slow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running he almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although here they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and protrusions  then right beside him lightly tossed something flew down and rolled in front of him  It was an apple then another one immediately flew at him Gregor froze in shock there was no longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard him  He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now without even taking the time for careful aim threw one apple after another  These little red apples rolled about on the floor knocking into each other as if they had electric motors  An apple thrown without much force glanced against Gregors back and slid off without doing any harm  Another one however immediately following it hit squarely and lodged in his back Gregor wanted to drag himself away as if he could remove the surprising the incredible pain by changing his position but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread himself out all his senses in confusion  The last thing he saw was the door of his room being pulled open his sister was screaming his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse as his sister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted to make it easier for her to breathe she ran to his father her skirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground stumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father her arms around him uniting herself with him totally  now Gregor lost his ability to see anything  her hands behind his fathers head begging him to spare Gregors life       III     Noone dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregors flesh so it remained there as a visible reminder of his injury  He had suffered it there for more than a month and his condition seemed serious enough to remind even his father that Gregor despite his current sad and revolting form was a family member who could not be treated as an enemy  On the contrary as a family there was a duty to swallow any revulsion for him and to be patient just to be patient   Because of his injuries Gregor had lost much of his mobility  probably permanently  He had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid and it took him long long minutes to crawl across his room  crawling over the ceiling was out of the question  but this deterioration in his condition was fully in his opinion made up for by the door to the living room being left open every evening  He got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then lying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the living room he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table and listen to their conversation  with everyones permission in a way and thus quite differently from before   They no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times of course the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when he was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room  All of them were usually very quiet nowadays  Soon after dinner his father would go to sleep in his chair his mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet his mother bent deeply under the lamp would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop his sister who had taken a sales job learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be able to get a better position later on Sometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregors mother youre doing so much sewing again today as if he did not know that he had been dozing  and then he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin   With a kind of stubbornness Gregors father refused to take his uniform off even at home while his nightgown hung unused on its peg Gregors father would slumber where he was fully dressed as if always ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even here  The uniform had not been new to start with but as a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of Gregors mother and sister to look after it  Gregor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny while the old man in it would sleep highly uncomfortable but peaceful   As soon as it struck ten Gregors mother would speak gently to his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed as he couldnt sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get to work  But since he had been in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed  Then however much mother and sister would importune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up  Gregors mother would tug at his sleeve whisper endearments into his ear Gregors sister would leave her work to help her mother but nothing would have any effect on him  He would just sink deeper into his chair  Only when the two women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes look at them one after the other and say What a life This is what peace I get in my old age  And supported by the two women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself let the women take him to the door send them off and carry on by himself while Gregors mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being of help to him   Who in this tired and overworked family would have had time to give more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary The household budget became even smaller so now the maid was dismissed an enormous thickboned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work everything else was looked after by Gregors mother on top of the large amount of sewing work she did  Gregor even learned listening to the evening conversation about what price they had hoped for that several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and celebrations  But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances they could not move out of it there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address  He could see quite well though that there were more reasons than consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move it would have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with a few air holes in it the main thing holding the family back from their decision to move was much more to do with their total despair and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to  They carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people Gregors father brought bank employees their breakfast his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers but they just did not have the strength to do any more  And the injury in Gregors back began to hurt as much as when it was new  After they had come back from taking his father to bed Gregors mother and sister would now leave their work where it was and sit close together cheek to cheek his mother would point to Gregors room and say Close that door Grete and then when he was in the dark again they would sit in the next room and their tears would mingle or they would simply sit there staring dryeyed at the table   Gregor hardly slept at all either night or day  Sometimes he would think of taking over the familys affairs just like before the next time the door was opened he had long forgotten about his boss and the chief clerk but they would appear again in his thoughts the salesmen and the apprentices that stupid teaboy two or three friends from other businesses one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel a tender memory that appeared and disappeared again a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow  all of them appeared to him mixed together with strangers and others he had forgotten but instead of helping him and his family they were all of them inaccessible and he was glad when they disappeared  Other times he was not at all in the mood to look after his family he was filled with simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown and although he could think of nothing he would have wanted he made plans of how he could get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to even if he was not hungry  Gregors sister no longer thought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the morning and at midday and in the evening she would sweep it away again with the broom indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or  more often than not  had been left totally untouched  She still cleared up the room in the evening but now she could not have been any quicker about it  Smears of dirt were left on the walls here and there were little balls of dust and filth  At first Gregor went into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her but he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing anything about it she could see the dirt as well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it At the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the family understood  cleaning up Gregors room was for her and her alone  Gregors mother did once thoroughly clean his room and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do it  although that much dampness also made Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch bitter and immobile  But his mother was to be punished still more for what she had done as hardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change in Gregors room and highly aggrieved ran back into the living room where despite her mothers raised and imploring hands she broke into convulsive tears  Her father of course was startled out of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless then they too became agitated Gregors father standing to the right of his mother accused her of not leaving the cleaning of Gregors room to his sister from her left Gregors sister screamed at her that she was never to clean Gregors room again while his mother tried to draw his father who was beside himself with anger into the bedroom his sister quaking with tears thumped on the table with her small fists and Gregor hissed in anger that noone had even thought of closing the door to save him the sight of this and all its noise   Gregors sister was exhausted from going out to work and looking after Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her but even so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place Gregor on the other hand ought not to be neglected  Now though the charwoman was here  This elderly widow with a robust bone structure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things in her long life wasnt really repelled by Gregor  Just by chance one day rather than any real curiosity she opened the door to Gregors room and found herself face to face with him  He was taken totally by surprise noone was chasing him but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in front of her  From then on she never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him  At first she would call to him as she did so with words that she probably considered friendly such as come on then you old dungbeetle or look at the old dungbeetle there  Gregor never responded to being spoken to in that way but just remained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been opened  If only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every day instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt like it One day early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the windowpanes perhaps indicating that spring was coming she began to speak to him in that way once again  Gregor was so resentful of it that he started to move toward her he was slow and infirm but it was like a kind of attack  Instead of being afraid the charwoman just lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth open clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregors back Arent you coming any closer then she asked when Gregor turned round again and she calmly put the chair back in the corner   Gregor had almost entirely stopped eating  Only if he happened to find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it leave it there a few hours and then more often than not spit it out again  At first he thought it was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating but he had soon got used to the changes made there  They had got into the habit of putting things into this room that they had no room for anywhere else and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen  These earnest gentlemen  all three of them had full beards as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door one day  were painfully insistent on things being tidy  This meant not only in their own room but since they had taken a room in this establishment in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen  Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate especially if it was dirty  They had moreover brought most of their own furnishings and equipment with them  For this reason many things had become superfluous which although they could not be sold the family did not wish to discard  All these things found their way into Gregors room  The dustbins from the kitchen found their way in there too  The charwoman was always in a hurry and anything she couldnt use for the time being she would just chuck in there  He fortunately would usually see no more than the object and the hand that held it  The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when she had time and the opportunity or to throw everything out in one go but what actually happened was that they were left where they landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere else  At first he moved it because with no other room free where he could crawl about he was forced to but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tired to death and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards   The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone and so the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening  But Gregor found it easy to give up having the door open he had after all often failed to make use of it when it was open and without the family having noticed it lain in his room in its darkest corner  One time though the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open and it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on They sat up at the table where formerly Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother they unfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks  Gregors mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes  The food was steaming and filled the room with its smell  The gentlemen bent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before eating it and the gentleman in the middle who seemed to count as an authority for the other two did indeed cut off a piece of meat while it was still in its dish clearly wishing to establish whether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the kitchen  It was to his satisfaction and Gregors mother and sister who had been looking on anxiously began to breathe again and smiled   The family themselves ate in the kitchen  Nonetheless Gregors father came into the living room before he went into the kitchen bowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table The gentlemen stood as one and mumbled something into their beards  Then once they were alone they ate in near perfect silence  It seemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth could still be heard as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice they might be  Id like to eat something said Gregor anxiously but not anything like theyre eating  They do feed themselves  And here I am dying   Throughout all this time Gregor could not remember having heard the violin being played but this evening it began to be heard from the kitchen  The three gentlemen had already finished their meal the one in the middle had produced a newspaper given a page to each of the others and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and smoking  When the violin began playing they became attentive stood up and went on tiptoe over to the door of the hallway where they stood pressed against each other  Someone must have heard them in the kitchen as Gregors father called out Is the playing perhaps unpleasant for the gentlemen We can stop it straight away  On the contrary said the middle gentleman would the young lady not like to come in and play for us here in the room where it is after all much more cosy and comfortable  Oh yes wed love to called back Gregors father as if he had been the violin player himself  The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited Gregors father soon appeared with the music stand his mother with the music and his sister with the violin  She calmly prepared everything for her to begin playing his parents who had never rented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen did not even dare to sit on their own chairs his father leant against the door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat his mother though was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat  leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it  out of the way in a corner   His sister began to play father and mother paid close attention one on each side to the movements of her hands  Drawn in by the playing Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in the living room  Before he had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless about the others  Whats more there was now all the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest movement he carried threads hairs and remains of food about on his back and sides he was much too indifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used to do several times a day  And despite this condition he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living room   Noone noticed him though  The family was totally preoccupied with the violin playing at first the three gentlemen had put their hands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look at all the notes being played and they must have disturbed Gregors sister but soon in contrast with the family they  withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half volume and they stayed by the window while Gregors father observed them anxiously  It really now seemed very obvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had been disappointed that they had had enough of the whole performance and it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed  It was especially unnerving the way they all blew the smoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses  Yet Gregors sister was playing so beautifully  Her face was leant to one side following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression  Gregor crawled a little further forward keeping his head close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came  Was he an animal if music could captivate him so It seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been yearning for  He was determined to make his way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her violin as noone appreciated her playing here as much as he would  He never wanted to let her out of his room not while he lived anyway his shocking appearance should for once be of some use to him he wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers his sister should not be forced to stay with him though but stay of her own free will she would sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to send her to the conservatory how he would have told everyone about it last Christmas  had Christmas really come and gone already  if this misfortune hadnt got in the way and refuse to let anyone dissuade him from it  On hearing all this his sister would break out in tears of emotion and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her neck which since she had been going out to work she had kept free without any necklace or collar   Mr Samsa shouted the middle gentleman to Gregors father pointing without wasting any more words with his forefinger at Gregor as he slowly moved forward  The violin went silent the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends shaking his head and then looked back at Gregor  His father seemed to think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out even though they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been  He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his body  Now they did become a little annoyed and it was not clear whether it was his fathers behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room without knowing it  They asked Gregors father for explanations raised their arms like he had tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room only very slowly  Meanwhile Gregors sister had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted  She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still playing but then she suddenly pulled herself together lay the instrument on her mothers lap who still sat laboriously struggling for breath where she was and ran into the next room which under pressure from her father the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward  Under his sisters experienced hand the pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room  Gregors father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants  He urged them and pressed them until when he was already at the door of the room the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby brought Gregors father to a halt  I declare here and now he said raising his hand and glancing at Gregors mother and sister to gain their attention too that with regard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family  here he looked briefly but decisively at the floor  I give immediate notice on my room  For the days that I have been living here I will of course pay nothing at all on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action  He was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something  And indeed his two friends joined in with the words And we also give immediate notice  With that he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door   Gregors father staggered back to his seat feeling his way with his hands and fell into it it looked as if he was stretching himself out for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all Throughout all this Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen him  His disappointment at the failure of his plan and perhaps also because he was weak from hunger made it impossible for him to move  He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment and he waited  He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on his mothers lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on the floor   Father Mother said his sister hitting the table with her hand as introduction we cant carry on like this  Maybe you cant see it but I can  I dont want to call this monster my brother all I can say is we have to try and get rid of it  Weve done all thats humanly possible to look after it and be patient I dont think anyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong   Shes absolutely right said Gregors father to himself  His mother who still had not had time to catch her breath began to cough dully her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her eyes   Gregors sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead  Her words seemed to give Gregors father some more definite ideas  He sat upright played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal and occasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile   We have to try and get rid of it said Gregors sister now speaking only to her father as her mother was too occupied with coughing to listen itll be the death of both of you I can see it coming  We cant all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured like this we cant endure it  I cant endure it any more  And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her mother and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements   My child said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding what are we to do   His sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness and tears that had taken hold of her displacing her earlier certainty   If he could just understand us said his father almost as a question his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that of that there was no question   If he could just understand us repeated Gregors father closing his eyes in acceptance of his sisters certainty that that was quite impossible then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement with him  But as it is    Its got to go shouted his sister thats the only way Father Youve got to get rid of the idea that thats Gregor  Weve only harmed ourselves by believing it for so long  How can that be Gregor If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that its not possible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of his own free will  We wouldnt have a brother any more then but we could carry on with our lives and remember him with respect  As it is this animal is persecuting us its driven out our tenants it obviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on the streets  Father look just look she suddenly screamed hes starting again   In her alarm which was totally beyond Gregors comprehension his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay anywhere near Gregor  She rushed over to behind her father who had become excited merely because she was and stood up half raising his hands in front of Gregors sister as if to protect her   But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone least of all his sister  All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room although that was in itself quite startling as his painwracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help himself do it repeatedly raising it and striking it against the floor  He stopped and looked round  They seemed to have realised his good intention and had only been alarmed briefly  Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence  His mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed against each other her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion his sister sat next to his father with her arms around his neck   Maybe now theyll let me turn round thought Gregor and went back to work  He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had sometimes to stop and take a rest  Noone was making him rush any more everything was left up to him  As soon as he had finally finished turning round he began to move straight ahead  He was amazed at the great distance that separated him from his room and could not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little while before and almost without noticing it  He concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a word not any cry from his family to distract him He did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway  He did not turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff but it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him had changed only his sister had stood up  With his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen completely asleep   He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut bolted and locked  The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that his little legs collapsed under him  It was his sister who had been in so much of a rush  She had been standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly Gregor had not heard her coming at all and as she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents At last   What now then Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the darkness  He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all  This was no surprise to him it seemed rather that being able to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then was unnatural  He also felt relatively comfortable  It is true that his entire body was aching but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether He could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around it which was entirely covered in white dust He thought back of his family with emotion and love  If it was possible he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his sister  He remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning  He watched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too  Then without his willing it his head sank down completely and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils   When the cleaner came in early in the morning  theyd often asked her not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry she still did so that everyone in the flat knew when shed arrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace  she made her usual brief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing special  She thought he was laying there so still on purpose playing the martyr she attributed all possible understanding to him  She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand so she tried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway  When she had no success with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention She soon realised what had really happened opened her eyes wide whistled to herself but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms Come and ave a look at this its dead just lying there stone dead   Mr and  Mrs Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they could grasp what she was saying  But then each from his own side they hurried out of bed  Mr Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders  Mrs Samsa just came out in her nightdress and that is how they went into Gregors room  On the way they opened the door to the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in she was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this Dead asked  Mrs Samsa looking at the charwoman enquiringly even though she could have checked for herself and could have known it even without checking  Thats what I said  replied the cleaner and to prove it she gave Gregors body another shove with the broom sending it sideways across the floor  Mrs Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom but did not complete it  Now then said  Mr Samsa lets give thanks to God for that He crossed himself and the three women followed his example  Grete who had not taken her eyes from the corpse said Just look how thin he was  He didnt eat anything for so long The food came out again just the same as when it went in Gregors body was indeed completely dried up and flat they had not seen it until then but now he was not lifted up on his little legs nor did he do anything to make them look away   Grete come with us in here for a little while said  Mrs Samsa with a pained smile and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not without looking back at the body  The cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide  Although it was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it  It was already the end of March after all   The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement for their breakfasts  they had been forgotten about Where is our breakfast the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably  She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregors room  They did so and stood around Gregors corpse with their hands in the pockets of their wellworn coats It was now quite light in the room   Then the door of the bedroom opened and  Mr Samsa appeared in his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other  All of them had been crying a little Grete now and then pressed her face against her fathers arm   Leave my home  Now said  Mr Samsa indicating the door and without letting the women from him  What do you mean asked the middle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted and he smiled sweetly  The other two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could only end in their favour  I mean just what I said answered  Mr Samsa and with his two companions went in a straight line towards the man  At first he stood there still looking at the ground as if the contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new positions  Alright well go then he said and looked up at  Mr Samsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from Mr Samsa for his decision  Mr Samsa merely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times  At that and without delay the man actually did take long strides into the front hallway his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time before and had been listening to what was being said  Now they jumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the connection with their leader  Once there all three took their hats from the stand took their sticks from the holder bowed without a word and left the premises  Mr Samsa and the two women followed them out onto the landing but they had had no reason to mistrust the mens intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps  As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a few moments later the further down they went the more that the Samsa family lost interest in them when a butchers boy proud of posture with his tray on his head passed them on his way up and came nearer than they were  Mr Samsa and the women came away from the landing and went as if relieved back into the flat   They decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation and to go for a walk not only had they earned a break from work but they were in serious need of it  So they sat at the table and wrote three letters of excusal  Mr Samsa to his employers  Mrs Samsa to her contractor and Grete to her principal  The cleaner came in while they were writing to tell them she was going shed finished her work for that morning  The three of them at first just nodded without looking up from what they were writing and it was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation  Well asked  Mr Samsa  The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to report but would only do it if she was clearly asked to  The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat which had been a source of irritation to  Mr Samsa all the time she had been working for them swayed gently in all directions  What is it you want then asked  Mrs Samsa whom the cleaner had the most respect for  Yes she answered and broke into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away well then that thing in there you neednt worry about how youre going to get rid of it  Thats all been sorted out   Mrs Samsa and Grete bent down over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were writing  Mr Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything in detail but with outstretched hand he made it quite clear that she was not to  So as she was prevented from telling them all about it she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and clearly peeved called out Cheerio then everyone turned round sharply and left slamming the door terribly as she went   Tonight she gets sacked said  Mr Samsa but he received no reply from either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have destroyed the peace they had only just gained  They got up and went over to the window where they remained with their arms around each other  Mr Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat there watching for a while  Then he called out Come here then Lets forget about all that old stuff shall we  Come and give me a bit of attention The two women immediately did as he said hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished their letters   After that the three of them left the flat together which was something they had not done for months and took the tram out to the open country outside the town  They had the tram filled with warm sunshine all to themselves  Leant back comfortably on their seats they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination they were not at all bad  until then they had never asked each other about their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held particularly good promise for the future  The greatest improvement for the time being of course would be achieved quite easily by moving house what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by Gregor one that was in a better location and most of all more practical  All the time Grete was becoming livelier  With all the worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale but while they were talking  Mr and  Mrs Samsa were struck almost simultaneously with the thought of how their daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady  They became quieter  Just from each others glance and almost without knowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for her  And as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the first to get up and stretch out her young body             End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka Translated by David Wyllie

Most business owners and operators believed that it was a concern limited to some specific high-danger jobs, and were willing to settle for meeting the OSHA standards applied to their industry.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "But there was a cost associated with doing that, and it manifested itself in inflated workers' compensation claims and inflated insurance rates. Even then, many businesses just accepted that as the cost of doing business. And unless some major accident occurred, there wasn't any reason to revisit that decision.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Then, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic erupted into a global crisis that has had massive repercussions, affecting the way every business has to operate. And one of those effects is a new mandate to look after employees' health and take steps to keep workplaces infection-free. But doing so within an organization that's never preached or prioritized safety isn't an easy feat.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "To make it possible and to reorient businesses to handle their new workplace safety responsibilities requires building a positive workplace health and safety culture from the ground up. And here's a step-by-step road map to do just that.\r\n",

        "Step one: Create an accountability structure\r\n",
        "The first step in any effort to create a workplace health and safety culture is to decide who's responsible for monitoring the day-to-day behavior of all employees. In some instances, this is best accomplished by designating a point person for the task within each organizational group. In smaller organizations, having a single health and safety manager may suffice.\r\n",

        "The purpose of doing this is to make clear to workers at all levels that the business's health and safety priorities are serious business goals that will be actively tracked, measured, and, if necessary, enforced. This is even more important in the age of COVID-19, because a single non-compliant employee can wreak havoc on the whole business. There can be no room left for pleas of ignorance or a belief that the workplace's safety rules are merely best practices.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Step two: Choose success metrics\r\n",
        "Before designing a safety policy for the business, it's first necessary to define the goals the policy should meet and choose metrics to measure its effectiveness. This is the reason why construction sites often count the days between worksite accidents. But for an office setting, different metrics might be a better fit.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "For example, keeping track of the aggregated cost of the business's health and safety measures is a good first step. Then, measuring the total number of productive days worked by employees using the formula number of days worked / total business days X 100 provides a useful measure of any output lost to illness or injury. If the business value of that lost output is less expensive than the measures in place â the system's not working. If not, the business is on the right track.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Of course, that's not all there is to it. Other factors like workers' compensation incident rates and insurance costs must play a role in gauging success. And for best results, it's critical to remember that the more factors the business measures, the more accurate a picture will emerge. It's advisable to take as much time as needed to design an appropriate data collection and examination system.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Step three: Create clear safety policies\r\n",
        "With the right accountability structure and success metrics in place, the next step is to create comprehensive health and safety policies for them to enforce. To be clear â these should be far more strict and far reaching than what's contained in a standard OSHA-compliant policy statement. At the very least, it should contain whatever state-specific mandatory measures apply to the business's operating location.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "A comprehensive policy should strive to spell out things such as what's expected of employees, what consequences come with noncompliance and phased mitigation steps that would come into effect when necessary. But it shouldn't stop there. It should also establish a process for employees to report concerns and a process for how those concerns are to be dealt with. Doing so accounts for unforeseen problems and encourages the kind of communication that's necessary to establish a culture of safety in the organization.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Step four: Make safety training mandatory\r\n",
        "In most cases, businesses already have a legal obligation to provide some form of safety training to their employees. In multiple states, they now have to add COVID-19 specific training to their programs. But even where such measures aren't required, any business trying to create a culture of health and safety should make training a centerpiece of their efforts.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "But not all safety training programs are created equal. It's important to design a program that prioritizes engagement and promotes an ongoing conversation among employees. Then, follow-up refresher training efforts should avoid rote repetition of the rules and regulations in favor of participatory exercises that reinforce key concepts on an as-needed basis.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Step five: Design a rewards system\r\n",
        "As it's often said, deterrence and inducement go hand in hand. For that reason, businesses should reward employees for exemplary health and safety achievements instead of simply punishing them for failure. And the good news is that there are volumes of research into what types of incentive programs work and which don't.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The best way to proceed is to ask the employees that will be subject to the program for motivational ideas. They'll know what kinds of inducements will push them to do their best, and there's no better way to build a successful rewards program than that. The bottom line is, as long as the rewards are cost-effective and reasonable, give the workers what they want.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Step six: Formalize recognition\r\n",
        "Believe it or not, the possibility of gaining a reward isn't going to motivate every employee. Some just like to be noticed when they do good work. For them, a companywide recognition program makes an excellent companion to a rewards program. It can consist of something as simple as a monthly shout-out from managers or executive leadership for a job well done. Or, the business can organize a formal award that may be given to an employee who exemplifies the business's desired health and safety culture.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "What's more important, however, is that offering recognition to top safety performers provides a very visible signal to everyone involved that the company's committed to its health and safety policy. It elevates those goals to be on par with other business priorities, like achieving sales milestones or landing a new client. And that message speaks volumes about what matters to the business.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Staying safe together\r\n",
        "Once all of the needed policies, procedures, and organizational structures are in place, all that's left to do is execute on the agreed-upon policy and observe the results. Over time, the seriousness with which the business takes the health and safety of its employees will permeate the organization and lead to the creation of the desired health and safety culture.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "New employees will learn from existing employees how to maintain the highest standards of excellence, and managers will learn to recognize and reward their success. And most importantly, everyone involved will benefit from the effort. And in a world that has just provided tangible proof that workplace health and safety is critical to every business's success â that's a goal that every business should aspire to\"\"\""

            "For a long time, the concept of workplace and occupational safety wasn't something the average business worried about. Most business owners and operators believed that it was a concern limited to some specific high-danger jobs, and were willing to settle for meeting the OSHA standards applied to their industry.\n",
            "\n",
            "But there was a cost associated with doing that, and it manifested itself in inflated workers' compensation claims and inflated insurance rates. Even then, many businesses just accepted that as the cost of doing business. And unless some major accident occurred, there wasn't any reason to revisit that decision.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic erupted into a global crisis that has had massive repercussions, affecting the way every business has to operate.

              "For a long time, the concept of workplace and occupational safety wasn't something the average business worried about. Most business owners and operators believed that it was a concern limited to some specific high-danger jobs, and were willing to settle for meeting the OSHA standards applied to their industry.\n",
              "\n",
              "But there was a cost associated with doing that, and it manifested itself in inflated workers' compensation claims and inflated insurance rates. Even then, many businesses just accepted that as the cost of doing business. And unless some major accident occurred, there wasn't any reason to revisit that decision.\n",
              "\n",
              "Then, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic erupted into a global crisis that has had massive repercussions, affecting the way every business has to operate. And one of those effects is a new mandate to look after employees' health and take steps to keep workplaces infection-free. But doing so within an organization that's never preached or prioritized safety isn't an easy feat.\n",
              "\n",
              "To make it possible and to reorient businesses to handle their new workplace safety responsibilities requires building a positive workplace health and safety culture from the ground up. And here's a step-by-step road map to do just that.\n",
              "\n",
              "Step one: Create an accountability structure\n",
              "The first step in any effort to create a workplace health and safety culture is to decide who's responsible for monitoring the day-to-day behavior of all employees. In some instances, this is best accomplished by designating a point person for the task within each organizational group. In smaller organizations, having a single health and safety manager may suffice.\n",
              "\n",
              "The purpose of doing this is to make clear to workers at all levels that the business's health and safety priorities are serious business goals that will be actively tracked, measured, and, if necessary, enforced. This is even more important in the age of COVID-19, because a single non-compliant employee can wreak havoc on the whole business. There can be no room left for pleas of ignorance or a belief that the workplace's safety rules are merely best practices.\n",
              "\n",
              "Step two: Choose success metrics\n",
              "Before designing a safety policy for the business, it's first necessary to define the goals the policy should meet and choose metrics to measure its effectiveness. This is the reason why construction sites often count the days between worksite accidents. But for an office setting, different metrics might be a better fit.\n",
              "\n",
              "For example, keeping track of the aggregated cost of the business's health and safety measures is a good first step. Then, measuring the total number of productive days worked by employees using the formula number of days worked / total business days X 100 provides a useful measure of any output lost to illness or injury. If the business value of that lost output is less expensive than the measures in place â the system's not working. If not, the business is on the right track.\n",
              "\n",
              "Of course, that's not all there is to it. Other factors like workers' compensation incident rates and insurance costs must play a role in gauging success. And for best results, it's critical to remember that the more factors the business measures, the more accurate a picture will emerge. It's advisable to take as much time as needed to design an appropriate data collection and examination system.\n",
              "\n",
              "Step three: Create clear safety policies\n",
              "With the right accountability structure and success metrics in place, the next step is to create comprehensive health and safety policies for them to enforce. To be clear â these should be far more strict and far reaching than what's contained in a standard OSHA-compliant policy statement. At the very least, it should contain whatever state-specific mandatory measures apply to the business's operating location.\n",
              "\n",
              "A comprehensive policy should strive to spell out things such as what's expected of employees, what consequences come with noncompliance and phased mitigation steps that would come into effect when necessary. But it shouldn't stop there. It should also establish a process for employees to report concerns and a process for how those concerns are to be dealt with. Doing so accounts for unforeseen problems and encourages the kind of communication that's necessary to establish a culture of safety in the organization.\n",
              "\n",
              "Step four: Make safety training mandatory\n",
              "In most cases, businesses already have a legal obligation to provide some form of safety training to their employees. In multiple states, they now have to add COVID-19 specific training to their programs. But even where such measures aren't required, any business trying to create a culture of health and safety should make training a centerpiece of their efforts.\n",
              "\n",
              "But not all safety training programs are created equal. It's important to design a program that prioritizes engagement and promotes an ongoing conversation among employees. Then, follow-up refresher training efforts should avoid rote repetition of the rules and regulations in favor of participatory exercises that reinforce key concepts on an as-needed basis.\n",
              "\n",
              "Step five: Design a rewards system\n",
              "As it's often said, deterrence and inducement go hand in hand. For that reason, businesses should reward employees for exemplary health and safety achievements instead of simply punishing them for failure. And the good news is that there are volumes of research into what types of incentive programs work and which don't.\n",
              "\n",
              "The best way to proceed is to ask the employees that will be subject to the program for motivational ideas. They'll know what kinds of inducements will push them to do their best, and there's no better way to build a successful rewards program than that. The bottom line is, as long as the rewards are cost-effective and reasonable, give the workers what they want.\n",
              "\n",
              "Step six: Formalize recognition\n",
              "Believe it or not, the possibility of gaining a reward isn't going to motivate every employee. Some just like to be noticed when they do good work. For them, a companywide recognition program makes an excellent companion to a rewards program. It can consist of something as simple as a monthly shout-out from managers or executive leadership for a job well done. Or, the business can organize a formal award that may be given to an employee who exemplifies the business's desired health and safety culture.\n",
              "\n",
              "What's more important, however, is that offering recognition to top safety performers provides a very visible signal to everyone involved that the company's committed to its health and safety policy. It elevates those goals to be on par with other business priorities, like achieving sales milestones or landing a new client. And that message speaks volumes about what matters to the business.\n",
              "\n",
              "Staying safe together\n",
              "Once all of the needed policies, procedures, and organizational structures are in place, all that's left to do is execute on the agreed-upon policy and observe the results. Over time, the seriousness with which the business takes the health and safety of its employees will permeate the organization and lead to the creation of the desired health and safety culture.\n",
              "\n",
              "New employees will learn from existing employees how to maintain the highest standards of excellence, and managers will learn to recognize and reward their success. And most importantly, everyone involved will benefit from the effort. And in a world that has just provided tangible proof that workplace health and safety is critical to every business's success â that's a goal that every business should aspire to"

            "For a long time, the concept of workplace and occupational safety wasn't something the average business worried about.\n",
            "Most business owners and operators believed that it was a concern limited to some specific high-danger jobs, and were willing to settle for meeting the OSHA standards applied to their industry.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "But there was a cost associated with doing that, and it manifested itself in inflated workers' compensation claims and inflated insurance rates.\n",
            "Even then, many businesses just accepted that as the cost of doing business.\n",
            "And unless some major accident occurred, there wasn't any reason to revisit that decision.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Then, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic erupted into a global crisis that has had massive repercussions, affecting the way every business has to operate.\n",
            "And one of those effects is a new mandate to look after employees' health and take steps to keep workplaces infection-free.\n",
            "But doing so within an organization that's never preached or prioritized safety isn't an easy feat.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "To make it possible and to reorient businesses to handle their new workplace safety responsibilities requires building a positive workplace health and safety culture from the ground up.\n",
            "And here's a step-by-step road map to do just that.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Step one:\n",
            "Create an accountability structure\n",
            "\n",
            "The first step in any effort to create a workplace health and safety culture is to decide who's responsible for monitoring the day-to-day behavior of all employees.\n",
            "In some instances, this is best accomplished by designating a point person for the task within each organizational group.\n",
            "In smaller organizations, having a single health and safety manager may suffice.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "The purpose of doing this is to make clear to workers at all levels that the business's health and safety priorities are serious business goals that will be actively tracked, measured, and, if necessary, enforced.\n",
            "This is even more important in the age of COVID-19, because a single non-compliant employee can wreak havoc on the whole business.\n",
            "There can be no room left for pleas of ignorance or a belief that the workplace's safety rules are merely best practices.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Step two:\n",
            "Choose success metrics\n",
            "\n",
            "Before designing a safety policy for the business, it's first necessary to define the goals the policy should meet and choose metrics to measure its effectiveness.\n",
            "This is the reason why construction sites often count the days between worksite accidents.\n",
            "But for an office setting, different metrics might be a better fit.\n",
            "\n",

In multiple states, they now have to add COVID-19 specific training to their programs. But even where such measures aren't required, any business trying to create a culture of health and safety should make training a centerpiece of their efforts.</br></br>But not all safety training programs are created equal.
